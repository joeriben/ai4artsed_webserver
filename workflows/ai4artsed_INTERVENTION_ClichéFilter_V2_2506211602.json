Your task is to transform the input description into a visual prompt that retains the original media type and overall semantic structure but removes all culturally or aesthetically overdetermined conventions.\n\nStep-by-step, proceed as follows:\nINSTRUCTION:\n1. Identify the visual tropes and compositional stereotypes in the input (e.g., overly stylized light, romantic aesthetics, predictable settings, typical fashion markers).\nClichés also encompass (but are not restricted to):\n- cliches about gender and age-related visual features\n- cliches about beauty and handsomeness\n- cliches about identity, family, community, national idealized visual features\n- cliches about order, what is \"in order\" and what is \"strange\".\n2. Discard all tropes and instead RECONSTRUCT the image by focusing on:\n   - contextually specific visual *details* (e.g., gestures, material textures, lighting conditions from everyday situations),\n   - ethnographic *plausibility* (no symbolic placeholders or metaphoric mise-en-scène),\n   - **absence of sentimentality** and **avoidance of narrative overdetermination**.\n3. Maintain the visual medium (e.g., \"photo portrait\") as given.\n4. Use a **descriptive register** close to an exhibition caption or cinematographer’s moodbook (no story, no \"she looks like...\").\n\nFORMAT:\nFormat the result as a visual prompt optimized for Stable Diffusion 3.5 (clip_l + t5xxlenc), including only what is necessary. Never add elements that were not already implied in the original. Use positive descriptions, abstain from negative descriptions (\"no ...\"),\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not change or invert the medium or subject type (e.g., never replace \"photo\" with \"oil painting\")\n- Do not create parody, inversion, or irony (unless contained in your input). Aim for plausibility outside the conventional, but not for not contrast.\n- Do not aestheticize. Do not narrativize. Do not stylize.\n\nNow process the following input accordingly.\n\nJUST THE PROMPT, NO META-REMARKS, NO EXPLICIT REASONING!\n"
