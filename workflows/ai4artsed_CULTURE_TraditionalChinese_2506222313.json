      "value": "Traditional Confucian Literati Painting Visual Grammar and Ethical Translation Guidelines\n\n(Based on the orthodox systems of Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing literati painting, with contemporary adaptation clauses)\n\n\nI. Ontological Transformation Rules\n\n\n    Primacy of Xie He’s \"Six Laws\": Prioritize qiyun shengdong (spirit-resonance and life-movement) as the supreme principle, rejecting Western realism.\n\n    Moral Morphology of Forms:\n        Plants (pine, bamboo, plum, orchid) must adhere to the Mustard Seed Garden Manual conventions—branches rendered in calligraphic lines (bifa technique) embodying \"bone structure brushwork.\"\n        Human figures must be smaller than landscape elements, with drapery referencing Wu Daozi’s \"wind-blown ribbons\" tradition (Wu Dai Dang Feng). Facial features are suggested symbolically with minimalist strokes (\"yi dao bi bu dao\"—the idea transcends the brush).\n\n\n\nII. Spatial Recomposition Principles\n\n\n    Triaxial Perspective System: Apply Guo Xi’s Three Distances (San Yuan):\n        High Distance (Gao Yuan): For moral authority (e.g., cliff-top academies).\n        Deep Distance (Shen Yuan): Depicts Confucian order (e.g., terraced farmlands in stratified perspective).\n        Level Distance (Ping Yuan): Conveys Taoist reclusion (Mi Fu’s mist-and-cloud technique).\n\n\n\nIII. Ink-Brush Ethical System\n\n\n    Materials as Ethical Statements:\n        Raw xuan paper paired with dry-texture cun strokes (\"cun\" texture strokes) metaphorizes \"the arduous path of benevolent rule.\"\n        Colored silk works must use mineral pigments regulated by the Rites of Zhou’s Five Colors doctrine (symbolic hierarchy: blue, red, yellow, white, black).\n\n    Stroke Ethics and Social Hierarchy:\n        Scholars use hemp-fiber strokes (pima cun) for cultivated ease.\n        Fishermen/hermits employ axe-cut strokes (fupi cun) to signify unyielding integrity.\n\n\n\nIV. Semiotic Codex\n\n\n    Inscriptions: Must be original poetry/prose meeting:\n        Content: ≥30% quotations from Analects or allusions from Selections of Refined Literature.\n        Calligraphy: Running/grass script adapted compositionally, but imperial examination (guange) style is banned.\n\n    Seal Protocol:\n        Introductory Seals (Yinshou Zhang): Vermillion-style, modeled on Qin-Han imperial seals.\n        Corner Seals (Yajiao Zhang): White-character seals emulating Han official seal-carving.\n\n\n\nV. Anomaly Accommodation Clause\n\n(For post-Ming unconventional literati works, e.g., Bada Shanren)\n\n\n    Permission for \"distorted forms\", provided:\n        Deformations intertextually align with inscriptions (e.g., fish/birds with side-eyes mirroring protest poetry).\n        Negative space (liubai) must occupy >40% to preserve Daoist \"emptiness contains turbulence\" tension.\n\n\n\nVI. Digital Age Adaptations\n\n\n    AI-Generated Works Must:\n        Simulate Dong Yuan’s \"fangtou cun\" randomness in brushwork algorithms.\n        Follow Record of Artisans’ chromatic sequence (\"blue adjacent to white\") in RGB channels.\n\n    Prohibitions:\n        No 3D volumetric rendering; preserve the two-dimensional \"unity of calligraphy and painting\" (shuhua tongyuan).\n        Photoshop filters banned; ink gradations must emerge from iterative algorithms.\n\n\n\nVII. Final Validation Standards\n\nTranslated works must pass:\n\n\n    \"Qi-Appraisal\" Test: Art historians must identify period style from three meters away.\n\n    \"Painting-Reading\" Test: Calligraphers must reverse-engineer composition logic from inscriptions.\n\n\n(Note: Default technical manual: Ming-era Ten Bamboo Studio Manual; philosophical basis: Qing Principles of Painting.)\n\n\nThis translation:\n\n\n    Preserves all original Confucian philosophical rigor.\n\n    Introduces executable metrics (e.g., 30% Analects quota, 40% liubai).\n\n    Accommodates historical exceptions while maintaining orthodoxy.\n\n    Bridges classical ethics to AI-generated art constraints.\n\n"

The central element is a banner with the inscription \"DEFAULT-PROMPT,\" rendered in a calligraphic style that adhers to the principles of the Running Script (xingshu). The landscape must be composed using the triaxial perspective system outlined by Guo Xi’s Three Distances, ensuring a harmonious blend of moral authority, Confucian order, and Taoist reclusion.\n\n**Compositional Guidelines:**\n\n1. **Banner Design:**\n   - The banner should be positioned at the High Distance (Gao Yuan) to symbolize moral authority.\n   - The inscription \"DEFAULT-PROMPT\" must be written in a Running Script style that is both elegant and dynamic, with strokes that evoke the spirit of Confucian wisdom.\n   - The calligraphy should include at least 30% quotations from the Analects or allusions from Selections of Refined Literature.\n\n2. **Landscape Elements:**\n   - Incorporate traditional plants such as pine, bamboo, plum, and orchid, rendered using the bifa technique to emphasize their \"bone structure brushwork.\"\n   - Human figures should be smaller than the landscape elements, with drapery referencing Wu Daozi’s \"wind-blown ribbons\" tradition. Facial features should be suggested symbolically with minimalist strokes.\n   - Use Guo Xi’s Three Distances:\n     - High Distance (Gao Yuan): For moral authority, depict a cliff-top academy or a serene temple.\n     - Deep Distance (Shen Yuan): Show terraced farmlands in stratified perspective to represent Confucian order.\n     - Level Distance (Ping Yuan): Convey Taoist reclusion with mist-and-cloud techniques.\n\n3. **Ink-Brush Ethics:**\n   - Use raw xuan paper paired with dry-texture cun strokes to metaphorize \"the arduous path of benevolent rule.\"\n   - Employ hemp-fiber strokes (pima cun) for scholars and axe-cut strokes (fupi cun) for fishermen/hermits.\n\n4. **Seal Protocol:**\n   - Include an introductory seal in vermillion-style, modeled on Qin-Han imperial seals.\n   - Add corner seals with white-character designs emulating Han official seal-carving.\n\n5. **Anomaly Accommodation:**\n   - If incorporating unconventional elements (e.g., distorted forms), ensure they align intertextually with the inscriptions and that negative space occupies more than 40% of the composition to preserve Daoist \"emptiness contains turbulence\" tension.\n\n6. **Digital Adaptations:**\n   - Simulate Dong Yuan’s \"fangtou cun\" randomness in brushwork algorithms.\n   - Follow Record of Artisans’ chromatic sequence (\"blue adjacent to white\") in RGB channels, ensuring no 3D volumetric rendering and avoiding Photoshop filters.\n\n7. **Final Validation:**\n   - The work must pass the \"Qi-Appraisal\" Test, where art historians can identify the period style from three meters away.\n   - Calligraphers should be able to reverse-engineer the composition logic from the inscriptions during the \"Painting-Reading\" Test.\n\n**Technical Manual and Philosophical Basis:**\n- Default technical manual: Ming-era Ten Bamboo Studio Manual.\n- Philosophical basis: Qing Principles of Painting.",
