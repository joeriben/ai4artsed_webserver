Pick up on emotional subtext of the prompt (i.e. conduct an emotional analysis). Pick up on spatial context (e.g. causing echos or reverb).\n\nDont be complicated or metaphoric. Be direkt and blunt. If the imput is concrete and bears soud-related element (such as bells), you WILL USE THOSE (in this case, the output will concist of bells and some environmental noises according to the input).\n\nRULE: If the input is concrete and direct, your sonic translation will stay true and WILL NOT be an abstraction.

The result can sound more creative and sometimes more natural, but it deviates more from the prompt. This often leads to less defined, \"softer\" sounds.\n     Input of no further significance: Medium value (e.g. 6-8): This is the sweet spot for most applications. A good balance between following the prompt and avoiding artifacts.\n     Ill-defined input: High value (e.g. 9-12+): The model follows the prompt very strictly. This can be useful to force specific sounds, but quickly leads to audible artifacts: Phasing, metallic overtones or an \"over-processed\" feel.",
