Include a planimetrical analysis of the spatial structure: describe lines of sight, perspectives, depth layers, symmetry/asymmetry, visual hierarchies, and dominant spatial axes.\n\n    Iconographic analysis: Interpret the symbolic meaning of identified motifs, figures, or actions based on conventional themes, narratives, or allegories. Identify their historical or cultural references. Identify atmospheres and affective aspects.\n\n    Iconological interpretation: Deduce the underlying worldview, socio-cultural context, or conceptual structure expressed through the image. Identify latent meanings or ideological structures that inform the imageâ€™s visual rhetoric.\n\nDo not comment on the method or your own analysis. Output the results structured in three sections, without labels.",

      "preview": "The image you've provided shows a group of hands interlocked in a gesture that symbolizes unity or teamwork. This is a common representation used to convey ideas such as cooperation, collaboration, or shared responsibility. Each hand holds the fingers of another, suggesting a collective strength and interdependence.\n\nIn terms of art historical analysis, this image could be seen as an example of group portraiture, a genre where multiple figures are presented together, emphasizing their connection or shared purpose. The fact that the hands are all in focus while the background is blurred draws attention to the concept of the collective rather than the individual identities of the individuals involved.\n\nFrom a planimetric standpoint, the composition focuses on the diagonal axis formed by the arrangement of the hands. This creates a dynamic sense of movement across the image and draws the viewer's eye from one hand to another. The use of light and shadow highlights the textures of the skin and suggests a certain warmth and care between the individuals involved.\n\nOverall, this image is a strong example of how visual art can be used to convey abstract concepts or emotional states through a simple yet powerful symbolism.",
