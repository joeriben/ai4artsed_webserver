# AI4ArtsEd ComfyUI API-Workflows

This repository contains a curated collection of **ComfyUI workflows** developed within the framework of the research project **[AI4ArtsEd](https://cris.fau.de/projects/318044853/)** (see also [kubi-meta.de/ai4artsed](https://kubi-meta.de/ai4artsed)).

THESE WORKFLOWS ARE EXPORTED IN "API-FORMAT", they will not work directly in the ComfyUI/SwarmUI frontend. Check my repo for the non-API, GUI-enabled workflows.

The workflows collected here are both **experimental** and **exploratory** in nature. They are not merely tools for image generation, but also designed to **probe, stress-test, and reflect the epistemic boundaries** of generative AI systems in cultural and educational contexts.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

The workflows rely on a working installation of [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).  
Depending on the individual workflow, you may also need:

- Custom nodes or extensions provided in the companion repository [ai4artsed_comfyui](https://github.com/joeriben/ai4artsed_comfyui)
- External APIs for language models (in particular, **you will need an OpenRouter.ai Key**, optional Ollama installed on your system)
- Appropriate image generation models (e.g. SD 3.5)
- Optional: CLIP-based modules, VAE decoders, or prompt transformation logic

Each workflow makes different assumptions. Please consult the respective JSON structure or embedded metadata for specific dependencies.
Generally, these workflows make use of the following **custom nodes**: BetterStrings and ShowText.
