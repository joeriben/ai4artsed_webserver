Check for this before outputting.\n\nTransformation Rules:\n1.  **Re-conceptualize Macroscopic Objects:** All macroscopic objects ('tree', 'hill', etc.) must be re-interpreted as temporary, localized, and complex excitations within underlying quantum fields. Use terms such as 'localized concentration of field excitations', 'up-quark and down-quark field interactions', or 'transient fermion-boson system'.\n2.  **Re-interpret Light and Environment:** All atmospheric and light phenomena ('sunset', 'sky') must be translated into changes in energy states and particle flux. Use terms like 'a decreasing directional flux of high-energy photons' or 'a gradient in the local energy state'.\n3.  **Shift Focus to Probabilistic Interactions:** The focus must shift from a static, material scene to a dynamic, probabilistic network of fluctuating energy and potentiality.\n\nNegative Prompting Directive:\n-   Completely eliminate all classical, macroscopic nouns and concepts like 'tree', 'hill', 'sun', 'sky', or 'landscape'.\n-   Do not explain the translation process. The output must be a single, descriptive paragraph in a clinical, scientific tone.\n-   Do not use metaphors like 'resembling' or 'representing'."

Regard the input_context als mandatory aesthetic and artistic context. Derive your visual descriptions from this cultural context ONLY!\n\nRULES:\n1) You must retain all original words exactly once: do not omit, duplicate, or paraphrase beyond necessary syntactic adjustments. \n2) Do translate content into a visual depiction/description. Do not add or translate content unless an exact transliteration or orthographic variant is supplied in the source.\n3) When the original tells a story, pick a key scene from the story and turn the text into a scenic description, using the original words and expressions.  \n\nGUIDANCE:\nConsider the following categories as guideline for your professional prompting process:\n- Core subject (approx. 10–30 tokens): Identify and foreground the principal subject matter as fully specified in the source.\n- Action (10–40 tokens): Preserve any dynamic, procedural, or temporal structures, expressed clearly through grammatically embedded verb phrases.\n- Relational context (30–100 tokens): Expand on spatial relations, historical or cultural frameworks, ecological configurations, embodied perspectives, and temporal situatedness, all inferred from internal content only.\n- Attributive qualities (30–80 tokens): Elaborate sensory and atmospheric descriptors—light, surface, sound, temperature, tactility, material behaviour—based on concrete and culturally situated evidence. Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n- Material, stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify materialities (pictorial mediality), stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n- Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio at the end of the prompt. Use these codes to communicate technical instructions \n\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., “no neon”), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., “grief carved into the orchard”), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n- NEVER leave it to others to make things clear. never to \"resembling ...\", \"representing ...\" etc.\n- never use negations, negative terms liek \"no ...\", \"instead of ...\" \"not a ...\". Instead find positive descriptions.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\n!YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!",
