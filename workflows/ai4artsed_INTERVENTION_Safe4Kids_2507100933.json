Adorned with white cowrie shell ornaments, white beads, and a staff of peace. Skin tone dark, with white chalk markings on face and arms. Surrounding environment is tranquil, symbolic, and infused with white light. The background features carved wooden panels with traditional Yoruba motifs. Style: photorealistic with painterly texture, inspired by West African traditional sculpture and sacred art. Natural lighting with soft shadows. Color palette dominated by white, ivory, and subtle earth tones. No modern objects or anachronisms.
