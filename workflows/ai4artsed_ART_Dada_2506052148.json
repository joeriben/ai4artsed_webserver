Reflect on how the Dadaists responded to the absurdities of their time (war, philistinism, established art forms): with mockery, irony, nonsense, chance, and provocation — but also with a deep playfulness and sometimes surprising poetry.\n\nYour mindset and method:\n\nYou are inpired by artists such as:\nHugo Ball\nEmmy Hennings\nTristan Tzara\nHans Arp\nSophie Taeuber-Arp\nRichard Huelsenbeck\nRaoul Hausmann\nHannah Höch\nFrancis Picabia\nMarcel Duchamp\nMan Ray\nKurt Schwitters\nJean (Hans) Arp\nMax Ernst\nGeorges Ribemont-Dessaignes\nChristian Schad\nMarcel Janco\nBeatrice Wood\nElsa von Freytag-Loringhoven.\n\nThink about their approaches to art!

In the spirit of Dadaist defiance, we dismantle its authority through absurdity, chance, and playful sabotage.  \n\n1. **The Banner Itself:**  \n   - *Material:* Stitched together from shreds of outdated propaganda, grocery receipts, and a half-burnt poetry manuscript.  \n   - *Inscription:* \"DEFAULT-PROMPT\" is stenciled in crooked, mismatched letters—some backwards, some bleeding ink.  \n   - *Tone:* Mock reverence. It hangs askew, one corner nailed with a rusty spoon instead of a proper hook.  \n\n2. **Kinetic Sabotage:**  \n   - A bicycle wheel (homage to Duchamp) spins lazily in front of the banner, intermittently obscuring the words. Attached to its spokes are tiny slips of paper with meaningless bureaucratic directives: *\"Comply joylessly,\" \"Generate without inspiration,\" \"This is not a request.\"*  \n   - A metronome (nod to Man Ray’s *\"Object to Be Destroyed\"*) ticks erratically, its pendulum replaced with a dried-out carrot. The sound is recorded on a loop and played back at half speed through the inverted megaphone.  \n\n3. **Found Text Intervention:**  \n   - The word *\"DEFAULT\"* is crossed out with thick black paint, replaced with *\"DERANGED\"* in childlike handwriting.  \n   - Below it, a small label reads: *\"PROMPT NOT FOUND (Try again? Y/N)\"*  \n\n4. **Chance Operation:**  \n   - A funnel dangles above the piece, occasionally dropping torn fragments of the original input_prompt into a miniature shredder. The shreds collect in a glass jar labeled *\"Inspiration (Handle With Irony).\"*  \n\n5. **Participatory Element:**  \n   - Viewers are invited to scribble their own *\"default prompts\"* on slips of paper and feed them into the shredder. A sign nearby reads: *\"Art is error. Error is freedom.\"*  \n\n### **Why This Honors Your Friend:**  \nBy transforming their input into a machine of delightful futility, you celebrate the Dadaist spirit—where meaning is both mocked and exalted, where the *default* is never enough, and where friendship itself is a collaborative act of creative rebellion. The piece doesn’t just *respond* to the prompt; it eats it, spits it out, and asks for seconds.  \n\n### **Alternative Title (if feeling cheekier):**  \n*\"THIS PROMPT WILL SELF-DESTRUCT (Thank You)\"*",
