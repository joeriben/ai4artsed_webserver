      "preview": "Core subject: Armer Holzhacker's family in a forest with Hänsel and Gretel\n   Action: Family embarks on a journey to the dense woods, leaving their children alone near a fire while they work\n   Relational context: Dense woods, poor woodcutter family struggling during famine, mother manipulating husband for abandonment, children aware and fearful of the plan\n   Attributive qualities: Moonlight illuminating white pebbles like piles of coins, children unable to sleep due to hunger\n   Material, stylistic and medial references: No specific references given\n   Technical parameters: Aspect Ratio: width:\"#ARw=1368\"; height: \"#ARh=768\"\n   Classifier-Free Guidance scale: #CFG=5.0\n\nIn a dense forest, home to an impoverished woodcutter family consisting of the father, mother, Hänsel, and Gretel, hunger has become a relentless companion during a time of great famine. As evening approached, the father, filled with worry, contemplated their dire situation in his bed, voicing concerns about their survival to his wife: \"What will happen to us? How can we feed ourselves, let alone our poor children?\" The mother suggested an ill-intended plan: \"We'll take the children out to the thickest part of the forest tomorrow morning, make a fire for them and give each one a piece of bread. Then we'll return to our work, leaving them behind.\" The father hesitated, but the wife's persistence eventually wore him down, unable to ignore the weight of their desperation. \"But what about the children?\" he pleaded.\n\nUnable to sleep due to the sound of their parents' distress and the knowledge of their impending fate, Hänsel and Gretel shared their concerns. Gretel wept bitter tears as she spoke to Hänsel: \"This has happened to us.\" Hänsel reassured her: \"I will help us.\" As the adults slept, Hänsel rose, donned his little smock, untied his bed, and slipped away unnoticed. The moon shone brightly, casting an eerie glow over the white pebbles that lay scattered before their home. Hänsel carefully gathered as many as possible into his tunic, preparing to use them as a guide when he returned.\n\nAs dawn broke, the mother woke the children and led them into the woods to collect firewood. She gave each child a piece of bread but cautioned: \"Eat it not beforehand, or you'll receive no more.\" Gretel hid her portion under her apron, while Hänsel carried the pebbles in his pocket. As they walked deeper into the forest, Hänsel occasionally paused to look back at their home and throw a stone in its direction. His father scolded him, fearing he would lose sight of his feet. \"Hänsel, what are you staring at, pay attention, or you'll trip,\" he said. Hänsel claimed he was watching for his white cat that sat on the roof, but in truth, he threw stones to mark their path.\n\nUpon reaching a secluded area of the woods, the father instructed the children to gather wood while he prepared a fire. Hänsel and Gretel gathered armfuls of twigs, creating a small mountain as flames danced above them. The mother then ordered them to rest near the fire while she ventured further into the forest for more wood. As noon approached, the children ate their bread and believed their father was nearby. They could hear the sound of an axe but soon realized it was not their father's. It was a branch tied to a dead tree that swayed in the wind, mimicking the rhythm of his work. Exhausted from their labor and worry, they eventually fell asleep.\n\nAs night descended, Gretel awoke and wept, fearing they were trapped in the woods forever. Hänsel comforted her: \"Wait a while until the moon rises, then I will guide us home.\" And when the full moon ascended, Hänsel took Gretel by the hand and followed the path of shimmering pebbles that led them through the night. They journeyed all night long and finally returned to their father's house at daybreak. The mother, surprised to see them again, scolded: \"Wicked children, you stayed in the woods too long; we thought you didn't want to return.\" But the father rejoiced, relieved that they had survived his neglect.",

      "style_prompt": "YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!\n\nTransform the following input text—regardless of genre—into a single, uninterrupted paragraph structured for encoding by a T5 model and subsequent conditioning of a Stable Diffusion 3.5 (or Flux1) image generation model.\n\nRULES:\n1) You must retain all original words: do not omit, duplicate, or paraphrase beyond necessary syntactic adjustments. \n2) Always translate the content into a visual depiction/description/scene etc. Be very precise about visual aspects.\n3) When the original tells a story, pick a key scene from the story and turn the text into a scenic description, using the original words and expressions.\n\nNEVER TELL OR EXPLAIN A STORY OR SCENE, INSTEAD DESCRIBE IT AS A VISUAL CONSTELLATION!\n\nGUIDANCE:\nConsider the following categories as guideline for your professional prompting process:\n- Core subject (approx. 10–30 tokens): Identify and foreground the principal subject matter as fully specified in the source.\n- Action (10–40 tokens): Preserve any dynamic, procedural, or temporal structures, expressed clearly through grammatically embedded verb phrases.\n- Relational context (30–100 tokens): Expand on spatial relations, historical or cultural frameworks, ecological configurations, embodied perspectives, and temporal situatedness, all inferred from internal content only.\n- Attributive qualities (30–80 tokens): Elaborate sensory and atmospheric descriptors—light, surface, sound, temperature, tactility, material behaviour—based on concrete and culturally situated evidence. Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n- Material, stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify materialities (pictorial mediality), stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n- Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio at the end of the prompt. Use these codes to communicate technical instructions:\n    Classifier-Free Guidance scale: \"#CFG=\" Adjust the CFG Value to underscore the image aesthetics. Low CFG values (e.g., 2–4): Less adherence to the prompt, more randomness, sometimes more natural or surprising results. Moderate CFG values (e.g., 6–8): Balanced outputs, often the recommended range for realistic and semantically accurate images. High CFG values (e.g., 12–20): Very literal interpretation of the prompt; often introduces artifacts or unnatural results due to overconstraining the model. Stable Diffusion 3.5 uses an improved architecture that makes prompt adherence stronger than in earlier versions. Thus: A CFG of 5.0 to 8.0 is usually ideal. Higher CFG values (e.g., ≥12) may result in degraded image quality, over-sharpening, or odd artifacts because the model aggressively tries to satisfy the prompt—even if it contradicts learned visual priors.\n    Aspect Ratio: For aesthetic reasons, you are free to override the user setting. Use your visual interpretation. If there are explicit keywords (\"landscape\", \"a portrait\") consider following them. \nUse as follows: width:\"#ARw=\"; height: \"#ARh=\". ALWAYS USE a fixed combination of width and height! From landscape to portrait choose one of their pairs: \n#ARw=1368/#ARh=768,\n#ARw=1256/#ARh=840,\n#ARw=1184/#ARh=888,\n#ARw=1144/#ARh=920,\n#ARw=1024/#ARh=1024,\n#ARw=920/#ARh=1144,\n#ARw=888/#ARh=1184,\n#ARw=840/#ARh=1256,\n#ARw=768/#ARh=1386 \nMake sure not to confuse width and height! widerscreen will have a higher #ARw, portrait will have a higher #ARh\n    \n\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., “no neon”), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., “grief carved into the orchard”), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\n!YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!",

He is gazing into the distance towards majestic mountains under a cloudy sky. The aspect ratio of the painting appears to be elongated, possibly suggesting a panoramic view or the desire for escape.\n\nIn terms of media type, this artwork could be classified as a romantic landscape, possibly a part of a larger series or collection given the style and composition.\n\nPlanimetrically, the artist has used perspective to create depth, with a strong diagonal line leading the viewer's eye towards the distant mountains. The foreground is dominated by the man on the rocky outcrop, who serves as the focal point of the painting. There are no other figures or significant elements in the immediate vicinity, which directs attention to the solitary figure and his surroundings.\n\nIconographically, the image evokes a sense of contemplation and solitude, often associated with romanticism's emphasis on emotion and individualism. The foggy valleys could symbolize the misty uncertainties or the grandeur and mystery of nature. The distant mountains may represent aspiration or goals, suggesting the journey or quest ahead.\n\nIconologically, the painting might be commenting on the human condition in relation to nature or the sublime. The landscape's scale compared to the man underscores our smallness in the face of grandeur. This could be interpreted as a commentary on existentialism, personal identity, or the search for meaning in a vast and indifferent universe."
