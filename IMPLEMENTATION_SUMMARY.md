# Dual Input Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### 1. UI Changes (index.html, components.css)
- Changed single input field to dual input layout:
  - Prompt field: 4/5 width
  - Image upload area: 1/5 width with "+" icon in center
- Image upload area shows preview when image is selected

### 2. Frontend Logic (dual-input-handler.js)
- Created DualInputHandler class that manages the interaction between prompt and image inputs
- Handles three scenarios:
  1. **Prompt only**: Standard workflow execution
  2. **Image only**: Analyzes image first, then uses result as prompt
  3. **Prompt + Image**: 
     - For inpainting workflows: Sends both to server
     - For standard workflows: Analyzes image and concatenates with prompt

### 3. Workflow Classification (workflow-classifier.js)
- Detects inpainting workflows by checking for inpainting models in workflow
- Looks for patterns like "512-inpainting-ema.safetensors"

### 4. Backend Support (inpainting_service.py)
- `inject_image_to_workflow`: Injects image data into Load Image nodes for inpainting
- `analyze_and_concatenate`: Analyzes image and concatenates result with prompt text

### 5. Route Updates (workflow_routes.py, workflow_streaming_routes.py)
- Updated to handle new parameters:
  - `imageData`: The image data (for inpainting or combined mode)
  - `inputMode`: 'standard', 'inpainting', or 'standard_combined'
  - `requiresImageAnalysis`: Boolean flag for standard workflows with image

## How it works:

1. User enters prompt and/or uploads image
2. Frontend detects workflow type (inpainting vs standard)
3. Based on inputs and workflow type:
   - **Inpainting + both inputs**: Image sent to Load Image node, prompt used normally
   - **Standard + image only**: Image analyzed, result becomes prompt
   - **Standard + both inputs**: Image analyzed, result concatenated with prompt
   - **Any + prompt only**: Normal workflow execution

## Current Status:
- All components are implemented
- Testing image analysis functionality (which can take 1-2 minutes)
- The system should handle all three scenarios correctly
