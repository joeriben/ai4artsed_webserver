Webserver for complex ComfyUI-API-Workflows

## Metadata helpers

To scaffold placeholder entries in `workflows/metadata.json` for new workflow files run:

```
python scripts/prepopulate_metadata.py
```

This populates the metadata file with the filename, a cleaned-up workflow name and placeholder descriptions that can be edited manually later.
