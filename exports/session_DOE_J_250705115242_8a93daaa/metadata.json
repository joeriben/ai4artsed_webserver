  "prompt": "A close-up of a Calla Lily photographed in the style of Imogen Cunningham. Soft, diffused light from the side, gentle shadows on a neutral background. The texture of the flower petals is visible through fine gradation, while the form is emphasized by minimal depth focus. A classical black-and-white photograph taken with a large-format camera from the 1930s. A restrained mood, almost meditative gaze at the organic motif.",
