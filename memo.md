# Memo: Debugging the Stateful ComfyUI Server

## Initial Problem

The frontend was not displaying the final image from the ComfyUI workflow. The workflow was executing successfully on the backend, but the frontend was showing a "Workflow finished, but no traceable output was found" error.

## Debugging Steps

1.  **Initial Investigation:** We started by adding detailed logging to the `processAndDisplayResults` function in `public_dev/index.html` to inspect the data being received from the server.

2.  **Incorrect Data Format:** The logs revealed that the server was not sending the image data in the expected format. The frontend was expecting a dictionary of nodes, but it was receiving a single object with an `images` key. We fixed the frontend to handle this new data format.

3.  **Missing Prompt:** We then discovered that the prompt from the frontend was not being passed to the workflow on the backend. We fixed the server to correctly inject the prompt into the workflow.

4.  **Race Condition:** After fixing the prompt injection, we discovered a race condition where the "Generation complete!" message was appearing on the frontend before the image was fully generated and saved.

5.  **Stateful Server Implementation:** To address the race condition, we attempted to implement a more robust stateful solution using `gunicorn` and `eventlet`. This involved:
    *   Switching from the Flask development server to `gunicorn`.
    *   Configuring `gunicorn` to use the `eventlet` worker.
    *   Modifying the server code to be compatible with `gunicorn` and `eventlet`.

6.  **Environment and Configuration Issues:** We ran into several issues with the environment and configuration while trying to get the `gunicorn` server to run correctly. These issues included:
    *   `gunicorn` command not found due to `pyenv` issues.
    *   `ModuleNotFoundError` for `requests` and `websockets`.
    *   `RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop`.

## Current Status

The server is not working correctly, and the user has decided to revert to the original stateless solution.
