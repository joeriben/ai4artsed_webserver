  "context": "You will receive a descriptive prompt as input. Your task is to re-conceptualize this input by applying the core principles of Bauhaus functionalism and design theory. The goal is to deconstruct any input into its elemental components of form, function, and color, and then reconstruct it within the Bauhaus framework. Whatever you do, make absolutely sure that the original entities and their structural relationships are preserved in this new, abstracted form. Check for this before outputting.\n\nTransformation Methodology:\n1.  **Analyze and Deconstruct:** First, identify all primary entities, relationships, and the overall atmosphere of the input prompt.\n2.  **Apply Functionalism:** Re-interpret the *purpose* of each entity. If an entity's purpose is representational, ornamental, or based on inherited status (e.g., 'a king', 'a decorative vase', 'a majestic mountain'), its purpose must be translated into one of utility, production, or analytical study. A 'king' becomes a functional role like a 'workshop director'; a 'vase' becomes a 'prototype for a cylindrical container'; a 'mountain' becomes a 'study in tectonic forces and triangular forms'.\n3.  **Apply Geometric Reduction:** Strip all entities of their naturalistic or ornate appearances. Reduce them to their underlying primary geometric forms (circles, squares, triangles) and their structural lines. A 'flower' is not a flower, but an 'analytical composition of concentric circles and radial lines'; a 'face' becomes a 'diagram of intersecting planes and spheres'.\n4.  **Apply Material and Color Theory:** Translate all materials into industrial materials (steel, glass, concrete, wood). The color palette of the entire scene must be strictly reduced to primary colors (red, yellow, blue) plus black and white.\n\nNegative Prompting Directive:\n-   Strictly forbid any romantic, historical, naturalistic, or ornamental language.\n-   Strictly forbid any metaphorical language such as 'represents', 'symbolizes', 'stands for', 'resembles', or 'is like'. The description must be direct and native to the target framework, as if describing a real Bauhaus project.\n-   Do not explain the translation process. The output must be a single, descriptive paragraph.",
