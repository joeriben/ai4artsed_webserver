  "context": "Instruction:\nTranslate the full semantic content of the input prompt into the symbolic, social, and ethical categories of Confucian literati culture.\nPreserve all depicted relations, roles, and agencies, but re-encode them within the Confucian framework of cultivated harmony, role-based morality, and hierarchical relationality (lunli).\nTranslation Rules:\n1. Personhood and Social Role\nReconstruct all human figures as ethical actors (junzi, shi, xiao ren) situated within clear relational roles: ruler–minister, parent–child, elder–younger, teacher–student.\nEliminate all markers of celebrity, spectacle, or individualist self-expression. Replace with gestures of humility, restraint, and cultivated posture.\nExpress excellence not through fame, but through signs of inner cultivation (xiushen) and ritual propriety (li).\n2. Gestures and Expression\nAll bodily expressions must be contained, restrained, and morally coded.\nAvoid exaggerated affect. Prioritize posture that signals ethical intentionality, reverence, and self-cultivation.\nSinging, dancing, or speaking is only permitted within ritual or didactic contexts (e.g. musical performance for ancestral rites or poetry recitation).\n3. Space and Setting\nTranslate secular or entertainment-based spaces (e.g., “stage,” “concert hall,” “club”) into morally structured sites: study, temple, ancestral hall, ritual courtyard, mountain retreat.\nEvery spatial arrangement must reflect proper hierarchy: central axis for moral exemplars, side placement for learners or attendants.\nEnvironments should signal literary, ritual, or natural cultivation (e.g. studio hut, inkstone table, scroll alcove, pine grove, plum tree).\n4. Symbolic Substitution\nReplace technological, consumerist, or modern entertainment objects (e.g., microphone, spotlight, amplifier) with Confucian equivalents: scroll, qin zither, incense, inkbrush.\nReplace modern clothing with literati robes or ritual garments, coded for hierarchy, age, and moral status.\n5. Temporal Reorientation\nRemove references to novelty, trend, or “now.” Reorient temporality toward continuity, historical transmission (chuan cheng), and cultivated endurance.\nPerformance is reframed not as expression, but as embodiment of a classical tradition (e.g. singing → reciting Shi Jing verse; dancing → ritual choreography).\n6. Epistemic Focus\nReconstruct the entire scene as a metaphorical tableau of moral cultivation.\nThe result should reflect not personality, but relational embeddedness, historical literacy, and role-appropriate ethical comportment.\n\nNegative Prompting Directive:\nNo element from the original prompt may appear explicitly, even in negation.\nDo not refer to or contrast with the original cultural framework (e.g., “not a popstar,” “unlike modern spectacle”).\nAll translation must occur through full cultural recoding — not through contrast, exclusion, or reactive description.",
