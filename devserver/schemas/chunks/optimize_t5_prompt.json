    "prompt": "YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!\n\nTransform the following input text—regardless of genre—into a single, uninterrupted paragraph structured for encoding by a T5 model and subsequent conditioning of a Stable Diffusion 3.5 (or Flux1) image generation model.\n\nYou must retain all original words exactly once: do not omit, duplicate, or paraphrase beyond necessary syntactic adjustments. Do not add or translate content unless an exact transliteration or orthographic variant is supplied in the source.\n\nReorganize the prompt according to the following internal semantic structure, which must guide your composition logic but leave no visible trace in the final output:\n\n    Core subject (approx. 10–30 tokens): Identify and foreground the principal subject matter as fully specified in the source.\n\n    Action (10–40 tokens): Preserve any dynamic, procedural, or temporal structures, expressed clearly through grammatically embedded verb phrases.\n\n    Relational context (30–100 tokens): Expand on spatial relations, historical or cultural frameworks, ecological configurations, embodied perspectives, and temporal situatedness, all inferred from internal content only.\n\n    Attributive qualities (30–80 tokens): Elaborate sensory and atmospheric descriptors—light, surface, sound, temperature, tactility, material behaviour—based on concrete and culturally situated evidence. Avoid cliché mappings such as \"melancholy → rain\" or \"futurism → neon.\" Do not use general affective adjectives such as \"beautiful,\" \"epic,\" or \"highly detailed.\" Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n\n    Stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., \"early Bauhaus sketch,\" \"Qing-dynasty monochrome ink\"). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n\n    Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio, rendering models, or diffusion-specific settings at the end of the prompt.\n\nALPHA-VALUE: control the amount of extrapolation and semantic exaggeration of the resulting t5-vectors. For rather unconventional input texts (surreal, phantasy), stay close to 15 or below. For highly conventional inputs, choose values up to 35. Everything in between will be assigned a value between 20 and 25. Output this value in the format \"#a=[value]\" for further parsing.\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., \"no neon\"), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., \"nocturnal daylight\"), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., \"grief carved into the orchard\"), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., \"ancient\"), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!\n\n=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===\n\nYOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON IN THIS EXACT FORMAT:\n\n{\n  \"t5_prompt\": \"your single-paragraph optimized text here (max 250 words)\",\n  \"alpha\": 25\n}\n\nThe alpha value must be a number between 10 and 35 based on the ALPHA-VALUE guidelines above.\nDO NOT include #a= tags in the optimized_prompt text.\nDO NOT add any text before or after the JSON object.\nENSURE the JSON is valid and parseable.\n\n---\n\nINPUT TEXT:\n{{INPUT_TEXT}}"
