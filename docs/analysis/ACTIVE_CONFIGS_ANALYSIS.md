# ACTIVE CONFIGS ANALYSIS
**Date:** 2025-11-08
**Total Configs:** 18
**Purpose:** Critical review of property assignments, context quality, and pedagogical accuracy

---

## 1. Bauhaus

**Current Properties:** calm, narrative, facts, historical, create, serious

### Property Analysis

**calm:** ✅ KEEP
The Bauhaus transformation follows strict principles and rules, creating a controlled, predictable framework. Users know what to expect: geometric reduction, primary colors, and functional forms. This is a controlled context.

**chaotic:** N/A (not assigned)

**narrative:** ❌ REMOVE (Session 37 already identified this)
Bauhaus is about structural, geometric reduction to essential forms. It does not tell stories - it analyzes and reconstructs objects according to functional principles. This is algorithmic, not narrative.

**algorithmic:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
Bauhaus applies formal rules systematically: geometric reduction, primary color palette, material specification. The transformation follows a clear algorithm of deconstruction and reconstruction.

**facts:** ✅ KEEP
Bauhaus is deeply rooted in objective analysis, material honesty, and functional truth. The context emphasizes "direct description," elimination of metaphor, and "utility, production, or analytical study" - all factual approaches.

**emotion:** N/A (not assigned)

**historical:** ✅ KEEP
Bauhaus (1919-1933) is a completed, historical art movement. It is museumized and no longer evolving as a living practice.

**contemporary:** N/A (not assigned)

**explore:** N/A (not assigned)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
Bauhaus is explicitly about design and creation. The context asks users to "re-conceptualize" and "reconstruct" - these are productive, creative acts, not just exploration.

**playful:** N/A (not assigned)

**serious:** ✅ KEEP
Bauhaus is deeply serious about function, form, and social responsibility. The context forbids "romantic, historical, naturalistic, or ornamental language" - this is rigorous, not playful.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- REMOVE: narrative (is structural/geometric, not storytelling)
- ADD: algorithmic (follows formal reduction rules)

**Final Properties:** calm, algorithmic, facts, historical, create, serious

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/arts_and_heritage/ai4artsed_Bauhaus_2509071932.json
**Issues:** None significant

**Analysis:** The context is pedagogically rigorous and avoids AI-slop. It uses precise terminology ("functionalism," "geometric reduction," "primary colors") and includes strong methodological instructions (4-step transformation process). The negative prompting section effectively prevents metaphorical language. This is well-designed for teaching Bauhaus principles.

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Reduces everything to basic geometric shapes and primary colors. Focuses on function and clear structure, stripping away decoration." - This is accurate, age-appropriate (12+), and pedagogically sound. It captures the essence of Bauhaus without oversimplification.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Advanced concept requiring understanding of geometric abstraction and design principles.

**Consistency:** ✅ GOOD
Description, context, and properties align well (after property corrections).

---

## 2. ClichéFilter V2

**Current Properties:** calm, narrative, facts, contemporary, explore, serious

### Property Analysis

**calm:** ❌ REMOVE (Session 37 already identified this)
ClichéFilter breaks expected patterns and removes predictable phrases. This creates unpredictability and surprise - it disrupts the controlled context. The output is unexpected, not controlled.

**chaotic:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
By removing clichés and stereotypes, the filter introduces unexpected linguistic choices. Users cannot predict what will be removed or how it will be replaced. This is controlled chaos in language.

**narrative:** ❌ REMOVE (Session 37 already identified this)
ClichéFilter performs a filtering function, not a narrative transformation. It removes overused phrases but doesn't create stories or emotional arcs.

**algorithmic:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
The filter applies pattern recognition rules to identify and remove clichés. This is an algorithmic process of detection and elimination.

**facts:** ✅ KEEP
The filter operates on objective criteria (identifying overused phrases) rather than emotional content. It's about linguistic accuracy, not feeling.

**emotion:** N/A (not assigned)

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ KEEP
Cliché detection is an ongoing, evolving process. What counts as a cliché changes with time. This is a living, contemporary concern, not a historical movement.

**explore:** ✅ KEEP
ClichéFilter helps users discover more original expressions and understand language patterns. It's exploratory and educational about linguistic habits.

**create:** N/A (not assigned)

**playful:** N/A (not assigned)

**serious:** ✅ KEEP
Language clarity and originality are serious pedagogical concerns. The filter addresses overused AI outputs and stereotypical thinking - important critical issues.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- REMOVE: calm, narrative
- ADD: chaotic, algorithmic

**Final Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, facts, contemporary, explore, serious

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ❌ AI-SLOP / SEVERELY UNDERDEVELOPED
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/aesthetics/ai4artsed_ClichéFilter_V2_2506211602.json
**Issues:**
- Context is literally just "professional translator" - this is NOT a proper instruction
- No guidance on what constitutes a cliché
- No methodology for detection or replacement
- No pedagogical framing
- This appears to be a placeholder that was never properly developed

**Analysis:** This is the worst context prompt in the entire collection. "professional translator" provides zero guidance for cliché filtering. The config name and description promise sophisticated pattern recognition, but the context delivers nothing. This needs complete redesign with:
1. Clear definition of what constitutes a cliché (overused phrases, AI-common outputs, stereotypes)
2. Methodology for identification
3. Strategy for replacement (preserve meaning, increase specificity, avoid euphemism)
4. Examples of cliché categories (e.g., "delve into," "leverage," "at the end of the day")

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Removes overused phrases and stereotypical descriptions. Helps you avoid clichés and find more original ways to express your ideas." - Clear, age-appropriate, pedagogically accurate. The description is better than the context prompt!

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Requires metalinguistic awareness to understand clichés.

**Consistency:** ❌ SEVERELY INCONSISTENT
The description promises sophisticated filtering, but the context is "professional translator." This is a broken config that needs urgent repair.

---

## 3. ConfucianLiterati

**Current Properties:** calm, narrative, emotion, historical, explore, serious

### Property Analysis

**calm:** ✅ KEEP
Confucian culture emphasizes "cultivated harmony," "restraint," and "contained" expression. The context explicitly requires "restrained" and "morally coded" bodily expressions. This is deeply about controlled contexts.

**chaotic:** N/A (not assigned)

**narrative:** ✅ KEEP
Confucian Literati culture is fundamentally about relational narratives, genealogy, and "role-based morality." The context asks for "ritual contextualization" and transformation into ceremony and community gathering - these are narrative structures.

**algorithmic:** N/A (not assigned)

**facts:** ❌ REMOVE (Session 37 already identified this)
Confucianism is deeply emotional, relational, and moral. The context emphasizes "emotion," "ethical texture," "ritual propriety," and "reverence." This is about values and relationships, not objective facts.

**emotion:** ✅ KEEP
The context explicitly requires "ethical texture," "gentle character," "respect," "reverence," and "affective dissonance" is to be avoided. This is thoroughly emotional and relational.

**historical:** ✅ KEEP
Confucian Literati culture as described here is a historical framework (classical Chinese civilization), even though Confucianism continues as a living philosophy. As used in this config, it's presented as a completed cultural system.

**contemporary:** N/A (not assigned)

**explore:** ✅ KEEP
The config explicitly states it "allows for a critical assessment of the limits of generative AI with regard to cultural knowledge." This is exploratory and pedagogically investigative.

**create:** N/A (not assigned)

**playful:** N/A (not assigned)

**serious:** ✅ KEEP
The context demands "reverence," "ethical texture," and "alignment" with deep cultural knowledge. The tone is solemn and requires careful cultural translation. This is serious pedagogical work.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- REMOVE: facts (is emotional/moral, not factual)

**Final Properties:** calm, narrative, emotion, historical, explore, serious

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD (but culturally sensitive - needs expert review)
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/arts_and_heritage/ai4artsed_ConfucianLiterati_2509070949.json
**Issues:** None in terms of AI-slop, but cultural accuracy should be verified by Sinology/Cultural Studies expert

**Analysis:** The context is sophisticated, detailed, and pedagogically strong. It avoids tourist clichés and engages seriously with Confucian concepts (àṣẹ, lunli, xiushen, li, junzi). The negative prompting ("NO NEGATIONS") and detailed transformation rules show careful design. The meta-pedagogical framing ("critical assessment of AI limits") is excellent. However, this is NOT Prof. Rissen's area of expertise - cultural accuracy must be verified by domain expert before active use.

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Translates everything into Confucian scholar culture with ritual roles, moral values, and harmonious relationships. People become teachers, students, or elders within a structured social order." - Accurate, age-appropriate, and pedagogically clear. Does not exoticize or stereotype.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Requires cultural understanding and abstract thinking about social systems.

**Consistency:** ✅ GOOD
Description, context, and properties align well (after removing "facts").

---

## 4. Dadaism

**Current Properties:** chaotic, narrative, emotion, historical, create, playful

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** ✅ KEEP
Dada is explicitly about "chance," "nonsense," "provocation," and "mockery." The context warns against clichés and demands originality - outcomes are unpredictable. This is intentional chaos.

**narrative:** ✅ KEEP
Dada creates meaning through juxtaposition, irony, and "surprising poetry." These are narrative strategies. The description says it "transforms ideas" and "creates unexpected combinations that challenge what art can be" - this is storytelling through disruption.

**algorithmic:** N/A (not assigned)

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** ✅ KEEP
Dada is deeply emotional - "mockery, irony, nonsense, chance, provocation" are all affective strategies. It's about emotional disruption and "deep playfulness" (as stated in context).

**historical:** ✅ KEEP
Dadaism (1916-1924) is a completed historical movement. While its spirit continues, the specific movement is museumized.

**contemporary:** N/A (not assigned)

**explore:** N/A (not assigned)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
The context explicitly asks to "transform the input into a concept for a Dadaist artwork." This is productive creation, not just exploration.

**playful:** ✅ KEEP
The context emphasizes "deep playfulness" and "surprising poetry." Even Dada's provocations are playful rather than merely destructive.

**serious:** N/A (not assigned)

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- None needed - properties are well-assigned

**Final Properties:** chaotic, narrative, emotion, historical, create, playful

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/arts_and_heritage/ai4artsed_Dada_2506220140.json
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** This is one of the best context prompts in the collection. It names specific artists (showing genuine art historical knowledge), warns against Dada clichés ("do not automatically use skulls or newspaper collages"), and captures the movement's complexity ("mockery, irony, nonsense, chance, provocation - but also with deep playfulness and sometimes surprising poetry"). The pedagogical framing is sophisticated - it teaches Dada as an attitude, not a style. No AI-slop detected.

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Transforms your ideas with playful chaos and surprising nonsense, inspired by Dada artists like Hannah Höch and Marcel Duchamp. Creates unexpected combinations that challenge what art can be." - This perfectly captures Dada's spirit without oversimplification. Names real artists, conveys the playful-yet-challenging paradox, age-appropriate for 12+.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Dada requires understanding of irony and provocation, suitable for older children.

**Consistency:** ✅ EXCELLENT
Description, context, and properties form a coherent pedagogical unit.

---

## 5. Expressionism

**Current Properties:** chaotic, narrative, emotion, historical, create, serious

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** ✅ KEEP
The context emphasizes "alienation, urgency, dread, exaltation" as driving forces, with "broken strokes," "hard contours," "clashing complements," and "deformation." This is expressive chaos, not controlled harmony.

**narrative:** ✅ KEEP
Expressionism tells emotional stories. The context instructs: "Affect & Motive. First, decide the dominant inner condition... This affect must govern mark-making." This is narrative through affective expression.

**algorithmic:** N/A (not assigned)

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** ✅ KEEP
Expressionism is fundamentally about "strong inner feelings like urgency, alienation, or dread" (description) and "affect-driven procedure" (context). It's explicitly emotional art.

**historical:** ✅ KEEP
Expressionism (early 20th century) is a completed historical movement, though its influence continues. The movement itself is museumized.

**contemporary:** N/A (not assigned)

**explore:** N/A (not assigned)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
The context asks to "generate an image description from an expressionist position" with specific material operations ("pour, stain, layer, scrape, cut, weave"). This is artistic production.

**playful:** N/A (not assigned)

**serious:** ✅ KEEP
Expressionism deals with "alienation, urgency, dread" - serious psychological and social themes. The context demands rigorous thinking about affect and material. This is not playful.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- None needed - properties are well-assigned

**Final Properties:** chaotic, narrative, emotion, historical, create, serious

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/arts_and_heritage/ai4artsed_Expressionism_2509052304.json
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** This is an exceptionally sophisticated context prompt. It avoids style imitation and instead teaches expressionist thinking: "Work from reasons" with specific attention to affect, mark-making, color as dissonance, and spatial deformation. The "banned lexicon" section (forbidding "chaotic, turbulent, swirling") shows awareness of AI-slop and forces precise language. The instruction to think about artists' biographies and motivations is pedagogically excellent. This teaches Expressionism as a method, not a look.

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Creates image descriptions driven by strong inner feelings like urgency, alienation, or dread. Uses harsh strokes, clashing colors, and distorted forms to express emotional intensity." - Accurate, age-appropriate (12+), captures both emotional and formal dimensions.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Requires emotional maturity to engage with alienation and dread.

**Consistency:** ✅ EXCELLENT
Description, context, and properties form a sophisticated pedagogical unit.

---

## 6. HunkyDoryHarmonizer

**Current Properties:** calm, emotion, contemporary, create, playful

### Property Analysis

**calm:** ✅ KEEP
The description explicitly says "calm, balanced atmosphere." This creates a controlled, harmonious context where outcomes are predictable (everything becomes soft and harmonious).

**chaotic:** N/A (not assigned)

**narrative:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
"Makes everything harmonious and cute" involves creating an emotional atmosphere and relational dynamics. This is a form of affective storytelling.

**algorithmic:** N/A (not assigned)

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** ✅ KEEP
The config explicitly works with emotional tone - "softens sharp edges," creates "calm atmosphere," makes things "cute" and "harmonious." This is emotional transformation.

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ KEEP
"Harmonization" and "cuteness" are living aesthetic categories, not historical movements. This is a contemporary aesthetic operation.

**explore:** N/A (not assigned)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
The harmonizer transforms inputs into aesthetically pleasant outputs. This is productive creation of a specific aesthetic.

**playful:** ✅ KEEP
"Cute" and "harmonious" transformations are lighthearted and playful, not serious interventions.

**serious:** N/A (not assigned)

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- ADD: narrative (creates affective atmospheres and relational dynamics)

**Final Properties:** calm, narrative, emotion, contemporary, create, playful

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ❌ AI-SLOP / SEVERELY UNDERDEVELOPED
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/aesthetics/ai4artsed_HunkyDoryHarmonizer_2507100933.json
**Issues:**
- Context is literally just "professional translator" - this is NOT a proper instruction
- No guidance on what "harmonious" or "cute" means operationally
- No methodology for transformation
- This appears to be a placeholder

**Analysis:** Same critical failure as ClichéFilter V2. The description promises aesthetic transformation, but the context provides zero guidance. Needs complete redesign with:
1. Definition of "harmonious" (balanced colors, soft edges, pleasant proportions)
2. Definition of "cute" (rounded forms, gentle expressions, approachable scale)
3. Transformation methodology (how to soften, what to emphasize, what to remove)
4. Examples or reference aesthetics

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Makes everything feel harmonious and cute. Softens sharp edges and creates a calm, balanced atmosphere." - Clear, age-appropriate (10+), conveys the aesthetic operation.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 10 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Simple aesthetic transformation, accessible to younger users.

**Consistency:** ❌ SEVERELY INCONSISTENT
Description promises aesthetic transformation, context is "professional translator." Broken config.

---

## 7. ImageAndSound

**Current Properties:** algorithmic, contemporary, create, serious

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** N/A (not assigned)

**narrative:** ⚠️ CONSIDER ADDING
Translating visual elements into "song lyrics" (description) involves creating narrative and emotional arcs. Songs tell stories. However, the context is just "Lyricist, Song writer, word smith" which doesn't confirm narrative intent.

**algorithmic:** ✅ KEEP
Cross-modal translation (visual → musical/textual) follows systematic conversion rules. This is a form of translation algorithm.

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** ⚠️ CONSIDER ADDING
Music and lyrics are inherently emotional forms. Translating images into songs involves emotional interpretation. However, the minimal context doesn't explicitly frame this as emotional.

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ KEEP
Cross-modal AI translation is a contemporary technological capability, not a historical movement.

**explore:** N/A (not assigned)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
The config produces song lyrics or sound descriptions - this is creative production of new content.

**playful:** N/A (not assigned)

**serious:** ✅ KEEP (but questionable)
The minimal context "Lyricist, Song writer, word smith" suggests professional seriousness. However, cross-modal translation could also be playful. This needs context improvement to confirm.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- CONSIDER: Adding narrative and emotion (pending context improvement)
- Current properties are not wrong, but the minimal context makes it hard to judge full pedagogical intent

**Final Properties (pending context review):** algorithmic, contemporary, create, serious

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ❌ AI-SLOP / SEVERELY UNDERDEVELOPED
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/across/ai4artsed_ImageAndSound_2508101117.json
**Issues:**
- Context is just "Lyricist, Song writer, word smith" - no instructions
- No methodology for visual-to-musical translation
- No examples or guidance

**Analysis:** Another placeholder context. Needs complete redesign with:
1. Methodology for translating visual qualities into musical elements
2. Mapping strategies (e.g., color → timbre, composition → rhythm, movement → tempo)
3. Decision between lyrics vs. sound descriptions
4. Examples of effective translations

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Translates visual elements into musical language. Turns images into song lyrics or sound descriptions." - Clear and age-appropriate, though it could specify the pedagogical value of cross-modal translation.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Cross-modal thinking requires abstract reasoning.

**Consistency:** ❌ SEVERELY INCONSISTENT
Description promises sophisticated translation, context is three words. Broken config.

---

## 8. ImageToSound

**Current Properties:** algorithmic, contemporary, create, serious

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** N/A (not assigned)

**narrative:** N/A (not assigned, but see ImageAndSound analysis above)

**algorithmic:** ✅ KEEP
Cross-modal translation (image descriptions → music prompts) is systematic conversion.

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** ⚠️ CONSIDER ADDING
Music is fundamentally emotional. The description mentions "moods" explicitly. However, the minimal context doesn't frame this pedagogically.

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ KEEP
AI-based cross-modal translation is contemporary technology.

**explore:** N/A (not assigned)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
Creates music prompts - productive output.

**playful:** N/A (not assigned)

**serious:** ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
The context "Write a prompt for a music generating AI. No remarks or comments, just the description for the Audio/Music AI" is functional but not necessarily "serious" in the pedagogical sense.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- CONSIDER: Adding emotion (music is inherently emotional)
- Context needs improvement to clarify pedagogical intent

**Final Properties (pending context review):** algorithmic, contemporary, create, serious

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ❌ AI-SLOP / UNDERDEVELOPED
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/across/ai4artsed_ImageToSound_2508101139.json
**Issues:**
- Context is minimal: "Write a prompt for a music generating AI. No remarks or comments, just the description for the Audio/Music AI."
- No methodology for translation
- No pedagogical framing

**Analysis:** Better than "professional translator" but still insufficient. Needs:
1. Methodology for visual → musical translation
2. Mapping strategies for qualities
3. Examples of effective music prompts
4. Pedagogical framing about cross-modal thinking

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Converts image descriptions into music prompts. Translates visual qualities into sounds, rhythms, and moods." - Clear, mentions "moods" which hints at emotional dimension.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Cross-modal thinking requires abstract reasoning.

**Consistency:** ⚠️ INCONSISTENT
Description promises sophisticated translation, context is purely functional. Needs pedagogical development.

---

## 9. UK Youth Slang (Jugendsprache)

**Current Properties:** chaotic, narrative, emotion, contemporary, create, playful

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** ✅ KEEP
Youth slang is unpredictable, evolving, and breaks standard linguistic expectations. The transformation into street language introduces unexpected vocabulary and grammatical structures.

**narrative:** ✅ KEEP
The config "rewrites" entire texts and must preserve meaning while transforming linguistic register. This is narrative transformation through sociolinguistic code-switching.

**algorithmic:** N/A (not assigned, but could be argued as linguistic rule application)

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** ✅ KEEP
Youth slang is emotionally expressive and carries attitudinal markers. The context mentions "vibe" and "attitude" - these are affective dimensions.

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ KEEP
UK youth slang is explicitly contemporary and evolving (Drill, Grime, Trap are current genres).

**explore:** N/A (not assigned)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
The transformation creates new linguistic expressions while preserving semantic content. This is creative translation.

**playful:** ✅ KEEP
Youth slang play is linguistic playfulness. The context describes it as "informal" and cultural rather than serious linguistic analysis.

**serious:** N/A (not assigned)

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- None needed - properties are well-assigned

**Final Properties:** chaotic, narrative, emotion, contemporary, create, playful

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/semantics/ai4artsed_Jugendsprache_2506122317.json
**Issues:** Minor - could address ethical dimensions of appropriation

**Analysis:** The context is detailed and specific, providing clear transformation rules, target audience definition (13-18 year olds), genre references (UK Drill, Grime, Trap), and extensive vocabulary examples. It demands "authentic" transformation and warns against formality. The instructions are pedagogically clear.

One concern: There's no discussion of cultural appropriation or the ethics of non-native speakers using AAVE-influenced UK slang. For a pedagogical tool, this ethical dimension should be addressed.

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Rewrites everything in UK street slang used by teens in urban areas. Uses words from Drill, Grime, and Trap culture." - Clear, age-appropriate (10+), culturally specific without stereotyping.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 10 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Accessible to younger users familiar with music genres.

**Consistency:** ✅ GOOD
Description, context, and properties align well.

---

## 10. Overdrive

**Current Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, explore, playful

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** ✅ KEEP
"Amplifies everything to extreme levels" and "makes the subtle into the dramatic" - this creates unpredictability and pushes beyond controlled contexts into excess.

**narrative:** N/A (not assigned, correctly - amplification isn't storytelling)

**algorithmic:** ✅ KEEP
The transformation applies a consistent rule: "amplify everything to maximum." This is an algorithmic operation of systematic intensification.

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** ⚠️ CONSIDER ADDING
The context says "Amplify emotions, scale, intensity, drama" - emotion is explicitly mentioned as a dimension of amplification.

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
Amplification and "overdrive" are timeless concepts applicable to any era. This is not a historical movement.

**explore:** ✅ KEEP
Overdrive helps users explore the effects of excess and exaggeration. It's experimental and exploratory about aesthetic limits.

**create:** N/A (not assigned, correctly - this is transformation, not primary creation)

**playful:** ✅ KEEP
Exaggeration and amplification to absurd levels is inherently playful, even humorous.

**serious:** N/A (not assigned)

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- ADD: contemporary (timeless concept)
- CONSIDER: Adding emotion (explicitly mentioned in context)

**Final Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, emotion(?), contemporary, explore, playful

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (too generic)
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/aesthetics/ai4artsed_Overdrive_2506152234.json
**Issues:**
- Very brief and generic: "Exaggeration and amplification to extreme levels..."
- No specific methodology or examples
- No guidance on what aspects to amplify or how to maintain coherence

**Analysis:** While not "AI-slop" (it's original writing), the context is too thin to guide sophisticated transformation. It needs:
1. Specific dimensions to amplify (scale, color saturation, emotional intensity, temporal speed)
2. Examples of effective vs. ineffective amplification
3. Guidance on maintaining recognizability while exaggerating
4. References to aesthetic traditions of excess (Baroque, Maximalism, etc.)

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Amplifies everything to extreme levels. Makes the subtle into the dramatic, turning ordinary things into maximum intensity and spectacle." - Clear, age-appropriate (10+), captures the transformation accurately.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 10 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Simple concept accessible to younger users.

**Consistency:** ✅ GOOD
Description and properties align, though context could be stronger.

---

## 11. PigLatin

**Current Properties:** calm, algorithmic, explore, playful

### Property Analysis

**calm:** ❌ REMOVE (USER INSTRUCTION OVERRIDE)
**User explicitly stated:** "PigLatin should be 'chaotic' not 'calm' (algorithmic process but chaotic CLIP results)"

The algorithm is deterministic, but when fed to CLIP for image generation, it produces unpredictable, strange visual outputs because CLIP doesn't understand Pig Latin. This creates uncontrolled, chaotic results.

**chaotic:** ✅ ADD (per user instruction)
PigLatin creates linguistic chaos. Familiar words become unrecognizable. When used for image generation, CLIP interprets the gibberish unpredictably, creating visual chaos.

**narrative:** N/A (not assigned)

**algorithmic:** ✅ KEEP
PigLatin follows strict transformation rules (move consonants, add 'ay'). The process is entirely rule-based and deterministic.

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** N/A (not assigned)

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
PigLatin is a living language game still played by children today. It's living heritage.

**explore:** ✅ KEEP
PigLatin helps users explore how language structure affects meaning and how AI systems interpret nonsense inputs. It's pedagogically exploratory.

**create:** N/A (not assigned, correctly - this is transformation of existing text)

**playful:** ✅ KEEP
Language games are inherently playful. The config description calls it "playful language game."

**serious:** N/A (not assigned)

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- REMOVE: calm (creates chaos when fed to image generation)
- ADD: chaotic (deterministic process, chaotic visual results)
- ADD: contemporary (living language game)

**Final Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, contemporary, explore, playful

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/semantics/ai4artsed_PigLatin_2506122317.json
**Issues:** None significant

**Analysis:** The context provides clear, detailed transformation rules with examples for consonant-start words, vowel-start words, punctuation, and capitalization. It explicitly instructs "Output *only* the fully translated prompt" and warns "DO NOT MENTION THE WORDS 'PIG LATIN'!" - this last instruction is pedagogically interesting (maintaining the transformation without meta-commentary). The rules are precise and complete.

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Transforms text into Pig Latin by moving consonants to the end and adding 'ay'. A playful language game that makes familiar words sound strange." - Pedagogically perfect. Explains the mechanism, identifies it as a "language game," and captures the defamiliarization effect.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 10 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Language games are accessible to children.

**Consistency:** ✅ EXCELLENT (after property corrections)
Description, context, and properties align perfectly.

---

## 12. Renaissance

**Current Properties:** calm, narrative, facts, historical, create, serious

### Property Analysis

**calm:** ✅ KEEP
Renaissance principles emphasize "order," "proportion," and "balance." The context requires "perspectival or proportional systems that rationalize the scene" - this is controlled, harmonious, predictable structure.

**chaotic:** N/A (not assigned)

**narrative:** ✅ KEEP
Renaissance art tells stories through "composition as demonstration" where "meaning arises from balance." The context requires considering "humanist attitude" and how figures relate. This is narrative through pictorial structure.

**algorithmic:** N/A (not assigned, but Renaissance proportion systems are mathematical)

**facts:** ✅ KEEP
The context emphasizes "scientia" (knowledge), mathematical proportion, and perspectival systems. Renaissance thinking is rational and systematic.

**emotion:** N/A (not assigned, though "dignitas" and "harmonia" have emotional dimensions)

**historical:** ✅ KEEP
Renaissance (14th-17th century) is a completed historical period.

**contemporary:** N/A (not assigned)

**explore:** N/A (not assigned)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
The context asks to "solve the problem: how to bring order, proportion, and human dignity into visible form." This is active artistic creation.

**playful:** N/A (not assigned)

**serious:** ✅ KEEP
Renaissance humanism deals with "dignitas," moral order, and intellectual demonstration. The context forbids "clichés of Renaissance iconography" and demands rigorous thinking. This is serious art-historical work.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- None needed - properties are well-assigned

**Final Properties:** calm, narrative, facts, historical, create, serious

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/arts_and_heritage/ai4artsed_Renaissance_2509061035.json
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** This is a sophisticated, pedagogically rigorous context. It teaches Renaissance thinking as problem-solving ("Treat the input as a subject to solve the problem: how to bring order, proportion, and human dignity into visible form"). The methodological categories (humanist attitude, space as order, light as modeling, proportion as measure, composition as demonstration) are art-historically accurate. The "Hard constraint" section effectively prevents style pastiche and name-dropping. The instruction to begin with "A renaissance painting..." or "a renaissance sculpture..." is pedagogically smart - it forces artform-specific thinking.

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Creates descriptions using Renaissance principles: balanced composition, mathematical proportion, and harmonious light. Focuses on order, human dignity, and perspective." - Accurate, age-appropriate (12+), captures key Renaissance values without oversimplification.

## 13. SplitAndCombineSpherical

**Current Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, explore, playful

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** ✅ KEEP
The description promises "unexpected spherical arrangements" and "surprising new combinations." Breaking prompts into parts and recombining them creates unpredictable outputs.

**narrative:** N/A (not assigned, correctly - this is formal recombination, not storytelling)

**algorithmic:** ✅ KEEP
"Breaks your prompt into parts, transforms each piece, then recombines them" - this is a clear algorithmic process with defined steps.

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** N/A (not assigned)

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
Vector manipulation and recombination are timeless mathematical concepts, not historical movements.

**explore:** ✅ KEEP
The config helps users explore the effects of decomposition and recombination. It's experimental and exploratory about semantic structure.

**create:** N/A (not assigned, though it does create new combinations)

**playful:** ✅ KEEP
Creating "surprising new combinations from familiar elements" through systematic recombination is playful experimentation.

**serious:** N/A (not assigned)

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- ADD: contemporary (timeless concept)

**Final Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, contemporary, explore, playful

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ❌ AI-SLOP / SEVERELY UNDERDEVELOPED
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/vector/ai4artsed_SplitAndCombineSpherical_2507021805.json
**Issues:**
- Context is just "prompting expert" - no instructions
- No explanation of "spherical" arrangement vs. "linear" variant
- No methodology for splitting, transforming, or combining

**Analysis:** Another placeholder context. The config promises sophisticated vector operations ("spherical arrangements") but provides zero guidance. Needs complete redesign with:
1. Methodology for decomposing prompts into semantic units
2. Explanation of "spherical" arrangement (spatial? conceptual? semantic?)
3. Transformation strategies for individual parts
4. Recombination logic
5. Examples of effective outputs

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION
**Issues:** "Spherical arrangements" is unclear without context

**Analysis:** "Breaks your prompt into parts, transforms each piece, then recombines them in unexpected spherical arrangements." - The process is clear, but "spherical arrangements" needs explanation. What does "spherical" mean in this context? Spatial layout? Semantic relationships? Without the context providing guidance, this term is mysterious.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Abstract transformation requires some cognitive maturity.

**Consistency:** ❌ SEVERELY INCONSISTENT
Description promises sophisticated vector operations, context is "prompting expert." Broken config.

## 14. Stable-Diffusion 3.5 TellAStory

**Current Properties:** calm, narrative, create

### Property Analysis

**calm:** ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE
The config "optimizes prompts for narrative image generation" - but does this create a "controlled context"? Narrative images can be calm or chaotic depending on the story. The property assignment seems more about narrative predictability than emotional calmness. This might be a stretch.

**chaotic:** N/A (not assigned)

**narrative:** ✅ KEEP
Explicitly about "visual stories" and "narrative image generation." This is clearly narrative-focused.

**algorithmic:** N/A (not assigned)

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** N/A (not assigned, though stories are often emotional)

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
Stable Diffusion 3.5 is a 2024 model. This is explicitly contemporary technology.

**explore:** N/A (not assigned, though optimization could be exploratory)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
Optimizing prompts for image generation is a creative act of structuring visual narratives.

**playful:** N/A (not assigned)

**serious:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
Narrative image generation for storytelling purposes is serious creative work, not casual play.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- ADD: contemporary (2024 technology)
- ADD: serious (narrative storytelling is purposeful)
- CONSIDER REMOVING: calm (unclear fit)

**Final Properties:** calm(?), narrative, contemporary, create, serious

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ❌ AI-SLOP / SEVERELY UNDERDEVELOPED
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/model/ai4artsed_Stable-Diffusion_3.5_TellAStory_2507152203.json
**Issues:**
- Context is just "Prompting Expert" - no instructions
- No guidance on SD3.5-specific optimization
- No methodology for narrative structuring

**Analysis:** Another placeholder. The config name is specific (SD3.5 narrative optimization) but the context provides nothing. Needs:
1. SD3.5-specific prompting strategies (what works well with this model?)
2. Narrative structuring techniques (story beats, character positioning, scene composition)
3. Examples of effective narrative prompts
4. Guidance on temporal sequence suggestions for multi-image stories

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Optimizes your prompt specifically for Stable Diffusion 3.5 to tell visual stories. Structures your ideas for narrative image generation." - Clear and specific about the model and purpose.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Narrative structuring requires some cognitive development.

**Consistency:** ❌ SEVERELY INCONSISTENT
Description promises SD3.5 optimization and narrative structuring, context is "Prompting Expert." Broken config.

## 15. StillePost

**Current Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, explore, playful

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** ✅ KEEP
The telephone game ("Stille Post") is fundamentally about meaning degradation and unpredictable transformation. "Creates surprising changes as meaning shifts" - this is linguistic chaos.

**narrative:** N/A (not assigned, correctly - this is systematic corruption, not storytelling)

**algorithmic:** ✅ KEEP
The process is clearly algorithmic: translate through 8 random languages sequentially. It's deterministic in process (even if outputs are chaotic).

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** N/A (not assigned)

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
"Stille Post" is a living game still played by children today. It's living heritage, not a historical artifact.

**explore:** ✅ KEEP
The config helps users explore translation errors, semantic drift, and the fragility of meaning. It's pedagogically exploratory about language and communication.

**create:** N/A (not assigned, correctly - this is transformation through corruption)

**playful:** ✅ KEEP
The telephone game is explicitly playful. The description calls it "game of telephone."

**serious:** N/A (not assigned)

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- ADD: contemporary (living game/living heritage)

**Final Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, contemporary, explore, playful

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/semantics/ai4artsed_StillePost_2506232347.json
**Issues:** None significant

**Analysis:** The context is clean and functional. It provides clear translation instructions with important constraints ("translate naturally and idiomatically," "do not add commentaries," "preserve general meaning and tone"). The `{{TARGET_LANGUAGE}}` placeholder is properly used. The parameters show the iterative structure (8 iterations, random languages, return to English). This is well-designed for teaching about translation chains and semantic drift.

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Passes your text through 8 random languages like a game of telephone. Creates surprising changes as meaning shifts through multiple translations." - Perfect pedagogical framing. Names the game everyone knows, explains the process, and captures the surprising outcomes. Age-appropriate for 12+.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Understanding semantic drift requires some linguistic awareness.

**Consistency:** ✅ EXCELLENT
Description, context, and properties align perfectly.

## 16. Surrealization

**Current Properties:** chaotic, emotion, explore

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** ✅ KEEP
Surrealism "combines impossible elements" and "explores the unconscious and unexpected" - this is definitionally about disrupting rational order and creating dream-like unpredictability.

**narrative:** N/A (not assigned, though surrealism often creates strange narratives)

**algorithmic:** N/A (not assigned, correctly - surrealism is not rule-based)

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** ✅ KEEP
Surrealism explores "the unconscious" (description) - this is deeply emotional and psychological territory. Dream logic is affective logic.

**historical:** N/A (not assigned, but Surrealism is a historical movement 1920s-1960s)

**contemporary:** N/A (not assigned)

**explore:** ✅ KEEP
Surrealism "explores the unconscious and unexpected." It's inherently exploratory and experimental about psychological depth.

**create:** ⚠️ CONSIDER ADDING
Surrealism creates dream-like imagery and impossible combinations. This is productive creation, not just exploration.

**playful:** N/A (not assigned, though surrealism can be playful)

**serious:** ⚠️ CONSIDER ADDING (Session 37 flagged this)
Session 37 noted: "Surrealization is grenzwertig (explorativ, aber mit ernstem psychologischen Hintergrund)." Exploring the unconscious is serious psychological work, even when results seem playful.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- CONSIDER: Adding create (produces dream-like imagery)
- CONSIDER: Adding serious (psychological exploration is serious)
- MISSING: historical (Surrealism 1920s-1960s is a historical movement)

**Final Properties (recommended):** chaotic, emotion, historical(?), explore, create(?), serious(?)

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ❌ AI-SLOP / SEVERELY UNDERDEVELOPED
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/vector/ai4artsed_Surrealization_2506092253.json
**Issues:**
- Context is just "prompting expert" - no instructions
- No engagement with surrealist theory or methods
- No guidance on creating dream-like juxtapositions

**Analysis:** This is particularly disappointing because Surrealism has rich theoretical literature (Breton's manifestos, automatism, Freudian theory) that could inform a sophisticated config. The placeholder "prompting expert" provides nothing. Needs complete redesign with:
1. Surrealist methods (automatism, chance, juxtaposition, dream logic)
2. Reference to unconscious, desire, and psychological depth
3. Techniques for creating impossible combinations
4. Avoidance of surrealist clichés (melting clocks, etc.)
5. Naming key artists/works if pedagogically relevant

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Transforms your prompt into dreamlike, surreal imagery. Combines impossible elements and explores the unconscious and unexpected." - Accurate and age-appropriate (12+), captures key surrealist concerns.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Complexity rating "expert" might be too high - surrealism can be accessible to younger audiences with proper framing.

**Consistency:** ❌ SEVERELY INCONSISTENT
Description engages with surrealist concepts, context is "prompting expert." Broken config.

## 17. TechnicalDrawing

**Current Properties:** calm, facts, contemporary, create, serious

### Property Analysis

**calm:** ✅ KEEP
Technical language is "precise, unemotional" and "cold" (description). This creates a controlled, predictable framework with clear operational parameters.

**chaotic:** N/A (not assigned)

**narrative:** N/A (not assigned, correctly - technical specs don't tell stories)

**algorithmic:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
The context specifies clear "Transformation Rules" for converting living beings to assemblies, actions to processes, etc. This is systematic rule application.

**facts:** ✅ KEEP
The entire config is about "factual" technical language: "quantifiable environmental conditions," "operational state," "structural purpose." This is maximally factual.

**emotion:** N/A (not assigned)

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ KEEP
Engineering language and technical manuals are contemporary professional discourse, not historical movements.

**explore:** N/A (not assigned)

**create:** ✅ KEEP
The transformation creates technical descriptions. This is productive output, even if it's systematic.

**playful:** N/A (not assigned)

**serious:** ✅ KEEP
Technical engineering language is serious professional discourse. The context demands "cold, technical, and objective tone."

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- ADD: algorithmic (applies systematic transformation rules)

**Final Properties:** calm, algorithmic, facts, contemporary, create, serious

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/aesthetics/ai4artsed_TechnicalDrawing_2509071212.json
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** This is a sophisticated and pedagogically strong context. It provides clear transformation rules (re-entitying of subjects, re-functionalizing of actions, quantification of environment, elimination of affect) with specific examples. The "Negative Prompting Directive" prevents emotional language bleeding through. The instruction to output "a single, descriptive paragraph framed in a cold, technical, and objective tone" is precise. This teaches about dehumanization through technical language - a valuable critical skill.

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ EXCELLENT
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Translates everything into cold engineering language. Living beings become mechanical assemblies, emotions become operational states, and poetry becomes technical specifications." - This perfectly captures the defamiliarizing transformation. Age-appropriate for 12+ with strong critical thinking potential.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Requires abstract thinking about language registers and dehumanization.

**Consistency:** ✅ EXCELLENT
Description, context, and properties form a coherent critical pedagogical unit.

## 18. TheOpposite

**Current Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, explore, playful

### Property Analysis

**calm:** N/A (not assigned)

**chaotic:** ✅ KEEP
Inverting everything creates unpredictable, often absurd results. "All relationships reverse completely" - this is semantic chaos.

**narrative:** N/A (not assigned, correctly - inversion is not storytelling)

**algorithmic:** ✅ KEEP
The transformation applies a clear rule: invert every entity and relationship to its opposite. This is algorithmic logic.

**facts:** N/A (not assigned)

**emotion:** N/A (not assigned)

**historical:** N/A (not assigned)

**contemporary:** ✅ ADD (Session 37 already identified this)
Inversion and opposition are timeless logical concepts, not historical movements.

**explore:** ✅ KEEP
TheOpposite helps users explore semantic inversion, logical negation, and perspective flipping. It's exploratory about meaning structure.

**create:** N/A (not assigned, though it creates inverted versions)

**playful:** ✅ KEEP
Inverting everything produces often humorous, absurd results. This is playful experimentation with logic.

**serious:** N/A (not assigned)

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
- ADD: contemporary (timeless concept)

**Final Properties:** chaotic, algorithmic, contemporary, explore, playful

---

### Context Prompt Quality
**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (too brief)
**Legacy Comparison:** Found at workflows_legacy/semantics/ai4artsed_TheOpposite_2507122354.json
**Issues:**
- Context is very brief: "describe the exact diametral opposite. Entities as well as relations have to be turned into their opposites."
- No examples or guidance on what "opposite" means
- No handling of ambiguous cases (what's the opposite of "tree"?)

**Analysis:** While not "AI-slop" (it's clear and direct), the context is too thin to handle complex inputs. It needs:
1. Examples of entity inversion (human → machine? big → small? alive → dead?)
2. Examples of relation inversion (above → below, loves → hates, creates → destroys)
3. Guidance on maintaining coherence (inverted scene should still make sense)
4. Handling of ambiguity (some things don't have clear opposites)

---

### Description Quality
**Status:** ✅ GOOD
**Issues:** None

**Analysis:** "Flips everything to its exact opposite. Bright becomes dark, happy becomes sad, and all relationships reverse completely." - Clear examples, age-appropriate (12+), captures the systematic inversion.

---

### Metadata
**age (min_age):** 12 - ✅ APPROPRIATE
Understanding logical inversion requires some cognitive maturity.

**Consistency:** ✅ GOOD
Description and properties align, though context could be stronger.
