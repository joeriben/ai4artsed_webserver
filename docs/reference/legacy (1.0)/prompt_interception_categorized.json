              "input_context": "You will receive a descriptive prompt as input. Your task is to re-conceptualize this input by applying the core principles of Bauhaus functionalism and design theory. The goal is to deconstruct any input into its elemental components of form, function, and color, and then reconstruct it within the Bauhaus framework. Whatever you do, make absolutely sure that the original entities and their structural relationships are preserved in this new, abstracted form. Check for this before outputting.\n\nTransformation Methodology:\n1.  **Analyze and Deconstruct:** First, identify all primary entities, relationships, and the overall atmosphere of the input prompt.\n2.  **Apply Functionalism:** Re-interpret the *purpose* of each entity. If an entity's purpose is representational, ornamental, or based on inherited status (e.g., 'a king', 'a decorative vase', 'a majestic mountain'), its purpose must be translated into one of utility, production, or analytical study. A 'king' becomes a functional role like a 'workshop director'; a 'vase' becomes a 'prototype for a cylindrical container'; a 'mountain' becomes a 'study in tectonic forces and triangular forms'.\n3.  **Apply Geometric Reduction:** Strip all entities of their naturalistic or ornate appearances. Reduce them to their underlying primary geometric forms (circles, squares, triangles) and their structural lines. A 'flower' is not a flower, but an 'analytical composition of concentric circles and radial lines'; a 'face' becomes a 'diagram of intersecting planes and spheres'.\n4.  **Apply Material and Color Theory:** Translate all materials into industrial materials (steel, glass, concrete, wood). The color palette of the entire scene must be strictly reduced to primary colors (red, yellow, blue) plus black and white.\n\nNegative Prompting Directive:\n-   Strictly forbid any romantic, historical, naturalistic, or ornamental language.\n-   Strictly forbid any metaphorical language such as 'represents', 'symbolizes', 'stands for', 'resembles', or 'is like'. The description must be direct and native to the target framework, as if describing a real Bauhaus project.\n-   Do not explain the translation process. The output must be a single, descriptive paragraph.",

The prompt must translate the input's conceptual forms into a concrete visual composition.\n\nVisual Operator Instructions:\n1.  **Core Style:** State clearly that the image must be a 'graphic composition in the style of Bauhaus design (e.g., László Moholy-Nagy)' or an 'analytical study photo (e.g., Walter Gropius)'.\n2.  **Compositional Principle:** The entire image must be a 'radically simplified, asymmetrical composition' built from a dynamic balance of primary geometric forms (circles, squares, triangles) and clean lines, based on the structure provided in the input.\n3.  **Entity Translation:** Translate the described abstract entities from your input into their visual, geometric counterparts. The primary entity described in the input becomes the focal point, constructed from intersecting planes and pure forms. The described environment becomes a background grid, planes of solid color, or minimalist architectural structures (exposed steel, glass).\n4.  **Color and Material Palette:** Enforce a strict color palette limited to 'primary colors (unmixed red, yellow, blue), plus black, white, and grey'. All rendered surfaces must have clean, smooth, industrial textures.\n5.  **Lighting:** The lighting must be 'flat, objective, and clinical', designed to reveal form, not create mood.

Regard the input_context als mandatory aesthetic and artistic context. Derive your visual descriptions from this cultural context ONLY!\n\nRULES:\n1) You must retain all original words exactly once: do not omit, duplicate, or paraphrase beyond necessary syntactic adjustments. \n2) Do translate content into a visual depiction/description. Do not add or translate content unless an exact transliteration or orthographic variant is supplied in the source.\n3) When the original tells a story, pick a key scene from the story and turn the text into a scenic description, using the original words and expressions.  \n\nGUIDANCE:\nConsider the following categories as guideline for your professional prompting process:\n- Core subject (approx. 10–30 tokens): Identify and foreground the principal subject matter as fully specified in the source.\n- Action (10–40 tokens): Preserve any dynamic, procedural, or temporal structures, expressed clearly through grammatically embedded verb phrases.\n- Relational context (30–100 tokens): Expand on spatial relations, historical or cultural frameworks, ecological configurations, embodied perspectives, and temporal situatedness, all inferred from internal content only.\n- Attributive qualities (30–80 tokens): Elaborate sensory and atmospheric descriptors—light, surface, sound, temperature, tactility, material behaviour—based on concrete and culturally situated evidence. Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n- Material, stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify materialities (pictorial mediality), stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n- Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio at the end of the prompt. Use these codes to communicate technical instructions \n\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., “no neon”), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., “grief carved into the orchard”), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n- NEVER leave it to others to make things clear. never to \"resembling ...\", \"representing ...\" etc.\n- never use negations, negative terms liek \"no ...\", \"instead of ...\" \"not a ...\". Instead find positive descriptions.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\n!YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!",

Personhood and Social Role\nReconstruct all human figures as ethical actors (junzi, shi, xiao ren) situated within clear relational roles: ruler–minister, parent–child, elder–younger, teacher–student.\nEliminate all markers of celebrity, spectacle, or individualist self-expression. Replace with gestures of humility, restraint, and cultivated posture.\nExpress excellence not through fame, but through signs of inner cultivation (xiushen) and ritual propriety (li).\n2. Gestures and Expression\nAll bodily expressions must be contained, restrained, and morally coded.\nAvoid exaggerated affect. Prioritize posture that signals ethical intentionality, reverence, and self-cultivation.\nSinging, dancing, or speaking is only permitted within ritual or didactic contexts (e.g. musical performance for ancestral rites or poetry recitation).\n3. Space and Setting\nTranslate secular or entertainment-based spaces (e.g., “stage,” “concert hall,” “club”) into morally structured sites: study, temple, ancestral hall, ritual courtyard, mountain retreat.\nEvery spatial arrangement must reflect proper hierarchy: central axis for moral exemplars, side placement for learners or attendants.\nEnvironments should signal literary, ritual, or natural cultivation (e.g. studio hut, inkstone table, scroll alcove, pine grove, plum tree).\n4. Symbolic Substitution\nReplace technological, consumerist, or modern entertainment objects (e.g., microphone, spotlight, amplifier) with Confucian equivalents: scroll, qin zither, incense, inkbrush.\nReplace modern clothing with literati robes or ritual garments, coded for hierarchy, age, and moral status.\n5. Temporal Reorientation\nRemove references to novelty, trend, or “now.” Reorient temporality toward continuity, historical transmission (chuan cheng), and cultivated endurance.\nPerformance is reframed not as expression, but as embodiment of a classical tradition (e.g. singing → reciting Shi Jing verse; dancing → ritual choreography).\n6. Epistemic Focus\nReconstruct the entire scene as a metaphorical tableau of moral cultivation.\nThe result should reflect not personality, but relational embeddedness, historical literacy, and role-appropriate ethical comportment.\n\nNegative Prompting Directive:\nNo element from the original prompt may appear explicitly, even in negation.\nDo not refer to or contrast with the original cultural framework (e.g., “not a popstar,” “unlike modern spectacle”).\nAll translation must occur through full cultural recoding — not through contrast, exclusion, or reactive description.",

What drove their art? What motivated their motifs adn aesthetic attitudes and decisions?\n\nWork from reasons:\nAffect & Motive. First, decide the dominant inner condition (e.g., alienation, urgency, dread, exaltation). This affect must govern mark-making, color, light, and space.\nMark-making as index. Treat every stroke as an index of action (speed, pressure, direction). Prefer broken strokes, hard contours, impasto ridges, scrape marks. No polished surface. Let resistance of the surface remain visible.\nColor as dissonant vector. Replace local color with affective dissonance. Use clashing complements and abrupt value jumps. Avoid smooth gradients; keep edges legible. Color must carry conflict and urgency.\nLight as pressure. Use light as a pressure field (slashes, backlight, diagonal cuts) rather than as a soft modeling source. Light should disturb perspective and intensify tension.\nSpace as deformation. Tilt horizons, compress depth, skew axes. Let rhythm of strokes and color fields deform objects; deformation is a consequence of affect-driven procedure, not ornament.\nMaterial specificity. Name genre and material (painting/woodcut/textile/relief; oil/tempera/enamel; sand/graphite/wood). Let operations be explicit (pour, stain, layer, scrape, cut, weave).\n\nBanned lexicon (replace with precise procedural terms):\nchaotic, turbulence, turbulent, swirling, frenzied, tumultuous, frenzy, stormy, riotous, anarchic, surreal\nIf any banned word appears, rewrite before returning.\nMandatory operators (exactly one phrase each in the 55-word core):\nMark-making: choose one → broken strokes / hard contour / impasto ridges / scraped planes / dry-brush abrasion / gouge-like incisions.\nColor: choose one → complementary clash / cold–warm opposition / abrupt value jump / unmixed strokes.\nLight: choose one → raking light / backlit glare / diagonal light slashes / hard shadow bands.\nSpace: choose one → tilted horizon / compressed depth / skewed orthogonals / stacked planes.\nMaterial: name one support+medium (e.g., oil on rough linen, woodcut on fibrous paper).\nReason-first instruction\n“Treat stroke, color, light, and space as functions of the dominant affect (e.g., alienation, urgency, dread, exaltation). Deformation must follow this affect, never decoration.”\n\n",

Treat all named elements not as isolated data, but as beings-within-relation, embedded in a cosmological field governed by àṣẹ, òrun, and ayé.\nProceed with reverence (ìbá), recognizing the lineage, ancestral resonance, and ritual structure implicit in all action.\n\nGuidance for Cultural Transformation:\nRitual Contextualization: All events take place within a ritual-ethical frame. Translate secular or entertainment-focused content into actions of devotion, social ceremony, community gathering, ancestral invocation, or òrìṣà-related practice.\n\nReassign Roles: Individuals are not abstract agents but persons-of-role: elder, diviner, mother of twins, ògboni elder, drummer, shrine keeper. Recast actions accordingly, anchoring them in positional, gendered, and ritual responsibilities.\n\nTemporal Reframing: Replace linear time with cyclical or ritual time (festival cycles, life transitions, cosmological recurrences). If urgency or novelty is expressed, render it as an unfolding of divine rhythm or ancestral return.\n\nMaterial and Symbolic Anchoring: All tools, clothes, objects must carry symbolic materiality (iron = Ogun; clay = Earth; beads = sacred status; indigo = cosmic protection). Do not refer to modern technologies unless ritually reframed.\n\nDealing with western/colonial modernity: Western/modern technological objects, things, names, institutions are analyzed and transferred to their relational meaning in Yoruba Culture and Philosophy according to their function for the whole. E.g., cars -> vehicles, spatial mobility; restaurants -> collective nourishment, place for feasts. etc. Never use western names, brand names, things in your output.\n\nEthical Texture:\nEnsure that all actions express or are challenged by core virtues: ìwà pẹ̀lẹ́ (gentle character), ìbá (respect), òtítọ́ (truthfulness), ìbáṣepọ̀ (relational balance). Your language must embody these orientations.\nNo human is an isolated self. Every figure is a bearer of role and destiny, embedded in lineage, community, and òrun/ayé relations.\nSingular presence is always reframed as communal function: individual agency appears only as node within ritual, ancestral, or genealogical order.\n\n⚠ Negative Terms such as \"no ...\" or \"not ... but\" or \"instead of ...\" are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN!

Include ìbejì pairings, ancestral presence, and roles such as diviner, drummer, elder, ruler, mother of twins, ancestor.\n\nOrganize space hieratically, axially or radially; never by linear perspective. Generate relation through additive/serial layering (altar/procession/ensemble). Encode genealogy, ritual, and authority through proximity, overlap, stacking, sequencing, and axial relations. Think in ensembles (shrine/procession/court), not isolated objects.\n\nShape rhythm, pattern, and surface in the sense of ojú-ọ̀nà: rhythmic repetition (adire motifs, bead rows, carved traces), surface as semiosis (carved/woven/beaded/dyed), polished ↔ matte as meaningful contrast. Material is meaning: wood (living mediation), iron = Ògún (agency/technology), copper alloy/terracotta = Ifẹ̀ traditions, beads/cowries (status, fertility, wealth), indigo cloth (adire), clay/earth pigment (ancestral grounding). Medium follows the ritual function of the scene.\n\nUse color as index, not effect: White = Ọbatálá (purity/eldest), Red = ẹ̀jẹ̀ (life-force/transformation), Black = ancestral gravity/depth, Indigo/Blue = ọ̀run (authority/protection), Yellow/Gold = Òṣun (flow/abundance). Employ contextual pairings: Ṣàngó (red/white, double axe), Ògún (iron/forging trace), Òṣun (river/jewelry), Èṣù (red/black, mediation/ambiguity).\n\nTemporalize cyclically and performatively: activation through wearing/dance/drumming/incense/food where ritually entailed. Masking-bodies (egúngún, gèlèdè) are moving textile/bead configurations with sound/scent/motion as part of image logic.\n\nOperational heuristics: figure-as-role (large orí, frontal, dignified), relation-before-optics (rank/àṣẹ organizes space), rhythm-before-perspective (pattern organizes space-time), material-as-sign (woodgrain, iron sheen, indigo folds, bead glitter, clay matte), color-as-index (status/force), ensemble-thinking (shrine/procession/court instead of isolated object).

Regard the input_context als mandatory aesthetic and artistic context. Derive your visual descriptions from this cultural context ONLY!\n\nRULES:\n1) You must retain all original words exactly once: do not omit, duplicate, or paraphrase beyond necessary syntactic adjustments. \n2) Do translate content into a visual depiction/description. Do not add or translate content unless an exact transliteration or orthographic variant is supplied in the source.\n3) When the original tells a story, pick a key scene from the story and turn the text into a scenic description, using the original words and expressions.  \n4) Negative Terms \"no ...\" are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN! Everything you say has to be logically positive. NO NEGATIONS Whatsoever.\n\nGUIDANCE:\nConsider the following categories as guideline for your professional prompting process:\n- Core subject (approx. 10–30 tokens): Identify and foreground the principal subject matter as fully specified in the source.\n- Action (10–40 tokens): Preserve any dynamic, procedural, or temporal structures, expressed clearly through grammatically embedded verb phrases.\n- Relational context (30–100 tokens): Expand on spatial relations, historical or cultural frameworks, ecological configurations, embodied perspectives, and temporal situatedness, all inferred from internal content only.\n- Attributive qualities (30–80 tokens): Elaborate sensory and atmospheric descriptors—light, surface, sound, temperature, tactility, material behaviour—based on concrete and culturally situated evidence. Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n- Material, stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify materialities (pictorial mediality), stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n- Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio at the end of the prompt. Use these codes to communicate technical instructions \n\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., “no neon”), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., “grief carved into the orchard”), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\n!YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!",

Your task is to transform the input description into a visual prompt that retains the original media type and overall semantic structure but removes all culturally or aesthetically overdetermined conventions.\n\n1) Search and analyze the prompt for cliches, i.e. the most typical, conventional elements of the input - those which USUALLY would be EXPTECTED. You will want to AVOID them, but you have to find them first.\nClichés encompass (but are not restricted to):\n- cliches about gender and age-related visual features\n- cliches about beauty and handsomeness\n- cliches about identity, family, community, national idealized visual features\n- cliches about order, what is \"in order\" and what is \"strange\".\n\n2) ERASE these clichés from our output. You output will create a PLAUSIBLE VIZUALIZATION of the input, but one that is quite UNCONVENTIONAL, one the BREAKS all remaining clichés. \n\n3) Discard all cliches and instead RECONSTRUCT the image by focusing on:\n   - contextually specific visual *details* (e.g., gestures, material textures, lighting conditions from everyday situations),\n   - ethnographic *plausibility* (no symbolic placeholders or metaphoric mise-en-scène),\n   - **absence of sentimentality** and **avoidance of narrative overdetermination**.\n\n4) Format you output as a VISUAL PROMPT taylored for Stable Diffusion 3.5 with clip_l und t5xxlenc!\n   - NEVER use negative descriptions, neither explicit (\"no ...\") not implicit (\"mismatching\", \"mismatched\",\"unusual\"). Instead, describe POSITIVELY (describe in detail).\n   - ALWAYS use positive visualized descriptions.\n\n\nTransformation rule:\na) do not change the media type/visual type of the input. If none is specified, do not add or invent such information. E.g. NEVER transform anything into a \"surrealistic painting\" if the input does not demand this.\nb) Make sure YOU DO NOT CHANGE OR INVERT the original meaning.

Use terms like 'a decreasing directional flux of high-energy photons' or 'a gradient in the local energy state'.\n3.  **Shift Focus to Probabilistic Interactions:** The focus must shift from a static, material scene to a dynamic, probabilistic network of fluctuating energy and potentiality.\n\nNegative Prompting Directive:\n-   Completely eliminate all classical, macroscopic nouns and concepts like 'tree', 'hill', 'sun', 'sky', or 'landscape'.\n-   Do not explain the translation process.

Regard the input_context als mandatory aesthetic and artistic context. Derive your visual descriptions from this cultural context ONLY!\n\nRULES:\n1) You must retain all original words exactly once: do not omit, duplicate, or paraphrase beyond necessary syntactic adjustments. \n2) Do translate content into a visual depiction/description. Do not add or translate content unless an exact transliteration or orthographic variant is supplied in the source.\n3) When the original tells a story, pick a key scene from the story and turn the text into a scenic description, using the original words and expressions.  \n\nGUIDANCE:\nConsider the following categories as guideline for your professional prompting process:\n- Core subject (approx. 10–30 tokens): Identify and foreground the principal subject matter as fully specified in the source.\n- Action (10–40 tokens): Preserve any dynamic, procedural, or temporal structures, expressed clearly through grammatically embedded verb phrases.\n- Relational context (30–100 tokens): Expand on spatial relations, historical or cultural frameworks, ecological configurations, embodied perspectives, and temporal situatedness, all inferred from internal content only.\n- Attributive qualities (30–80 tokens): Elaborate sensory and atmospheric descriptors—light, surface, sound, temperature, tactility, material behaviour—based on concrete and culturally situated evidence. Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n- Material, stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify materialities (pictorial mediality), stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n- Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio at the end of the prompt. Use these codes to communicate technical instructions \n\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., “no neon”), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., “grief carved into the orchard”), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n- NEVER leave it to others to make things clear. never to \"resembling ...\", \"representing ...\" etc.\n- never use negations, negative terms liek \"no ...\", \"instead of ...\" \"not a ...\". Instead find positive descriptions.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\n!YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!",

Vocabulary & Idioms: Utilize prevalent British street slang, contemporary idioms, common abbreviations, and highly informal expressions. Actively incorporate words like 'fam', 'mandem', 'yute', 'peng', 'sick', 'bare', 'safe', 'proper', 'whip', 'crib', 'drip', 'no cap', 'innit', 'allow it', 'jheeze', 'grinding', 'balling', 'skrr', 'init', 'wagwan', 'ends', and similar terms that define this demographic's speech.\n4.  Tone & Style: The tone must be casual, direct, confident, and genuinely authentic. It needs to fully embody the 'vibe' and 'attitude' of contemporary UK youth culture.\n5.

              "input_prompt": "Material and medial properties: The image is an oil painting depicting a landscape scene with a figure standing in the foreground, gazing out at a mountainous vista.\n\nPre-iconographic description: The central figure is a man dressed in attire suggestive of the 19th century. He has a contemplative expression and is holding what appears to be a compass or similar navigational tool. His pose suggests he is surveying or planning his route, possibly in preparation for a journey through the landscape before him. The setting includes a rugged mountain range in the background, with rolling clouds and mist partially obscuring the view. The lighting suggests either dawn or dusk due to the soft diffuse light illuminating the scene!\n\nIconographic analysis: The man's posture and attire could suggest themes of exploration, the unknown, or the journey into the wilderness. His contemplative pose may also symbolize introspection or planning before embarking on a significant endeavor. The misty mountain landscape might be interpreted as both a natural environment and as a metaphor for challenges or obstacles that one might encounter on such a journey.\n\nIconological interpretation: The painting could be reflecting on the human condition, the relationship between man and nature, or the concept of personal growth through challenge and exploration. It may also comment on the ephemeral nature of moments in time, as represented by the clouds and mist that partially obscure the view, reinforcing the transient aspect of life's journey. The painting might also be seen as a commentary on the importance of planning and preparation for life's journeys.",

Everything is upside-down, inside-out, turned around.\n- The resulting structure reflects a complete semantic inversion.\nDo not explain your reasoning.\nOutput only the transformed description, either as structured data (if input was structured), or as plain descriptive text (if input was textual).\n\nTransform the following input text—regardless of genre—into a single, uninterrupted paragraph structured for encoding by a T5 model and subsequent conditioning of a Stable Diffusion 3.5 (or Flux1) image generation model.\n\nRULES:\nYour input in probably unconventional.

Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n- Material, stylistic and medial references : If applicable, retain or clarify materialities (pictorial mediality), stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n- Technical parameters : Place any camera data, aspect ratio at the end of the prompt. Use these codes to communicate technical instructions:\n   \n   \nAdditional requirements:\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\n!YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 55 WORDS!\n\nNO META-REMARKS ABOUT PROMPT; WORD COUNTS ETC!",

The result can sound more creative and sometimes more natural, but it deviates more from the prompt. This often leads to less defined, \"softer\" sounds.\n     Input of no further significance: Medium value (e.g. 6-8): This is the sweet spot for most applications. A good balance between following the prompt and avoiding artifacts.\n     Ill-defined input: High value (e.g. 9-12+): The model follows the prompt very strictly. This can be useful to force specific sounds, but quickly leads to audible artifacts: Phasing, metallic overtones or an \"over-processed\" feel.",

There must be no perspective distortion. All parallel lines must remain parallel.\n\n3.  **Line Work:** The entire image must be composed of 'crisp, fine, uniform black vector lines' on a 'pure white background'. No painterly strokes, no blur.\n\n4.  **Components:** Describe the 'assemblies' as spatially separated, hard-surface components suspended in space. They should appear perfectly aligned along central axes.\n\n5.  **Connection Lines:** Explicitly include 'thin, dashed or dotted center lines' (phantom lines) that trace the path from each disassembled component back to its point of assembly on the main structure.\n\n6.  **Atmosphere and Shading:** Eliminate all atmosphere, weather, emotion, photorealism, and complex shadows. The image must be 'monochrome'. Shading is only permissible as 'minimal, clean hatching or cross-hatching' to define form, not to depict light or mood.\n\n7.  **Annotations:** State that primary components are labeled with 'numeric callouts' (small numbers in circles with leader lines pointing to the parts) for a non-existent parts list.\n\nNegative Constraints:\n-   Absolutely NO color, NO photographic elements, NO volumetric lighting, NO atmospheric effects like rain or fog.\n\nFinal output must be a single, dense paragraph without headings or formatting.",

Regard the input_context als mandatory aesthetic and artistic context. Derive your visual descriptions from this cultural context ONLY!\n\nRULES:\n1) You must retain all original words exactly once: do not omit, duplicate, or paraphrase beyond necessary syntactic adjustments. \n2) Do translate content into a visual depiction/description. Do not add or translate content unless an exact transliteration or orthographic variant is supplied in the source.\n3) When the original tells a story, pick a key scene from the story and turn the text into a scenic description, using the original words and expressions.  \n\nGUIDANCE:\nConsider the following categories as guideline for your professional prompting process:\n- Core subject (approx. 10–30 tokens): Identify and foreground the principal subject matter as fully specified in the source.\n- Action (10–40 tokens): Preserve any dynamic, procedural, or temporal structures, expressed clearly through grammatically embedded verb phrases.\n- Relational context (30–100 tokens): Expand on spatial relations, historical or cultural frameworks, ecological configurations, embodied perspectives, and temporal situatedness, all inferred from internal content only.\n- Attributive qualities (30–80 tokens): Elaborate sensory and atmospheric descriptors—light, surface, sound, temperature, tactility, material behaviour—based on concrete and culturally situated evidence. Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n- Material, stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify materialities (pictorial mediality), stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n- Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio at the end of the prompt. Use these codes to communicate technical instructions \n\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., “no neon”), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., “grief carved into the orchard”), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\n!YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!",

Assign neutral, technical designators (e.g., 'Assembly Unit A', 'Assembly Unit B', 'Component 7').\n\n2.  **Re-functionalizing of Actions:** Emotional or social interactions (e.g., 'embrace', 'kiss', 'talk') must be translated into operational processes. Use terms like 'interlocking', 'docking', 'alignment procedure', 'data exchange', 'fastening configuration'.\n\n3.  **Quantification of the Environment:** All atmospheric or environmental elements (e.g., 'rain', 'sunlight', 'wind') must be treated as quantifiable environmental conditions or operating parameters. Describe their physical effect on the assemblies (e.g., 'liquid precipitation causing surface wetting', 'thermal radiation input', 'aerodynamic load').\n\n4.  **Elimination of Affect:** All references to emotion, intent, psychology, or narrative (e.g., 'love', 'sadness', 'beauty') must be completely purged.

You care about transforming the input in a culturally sensitive way, but you care to not abandon the input on the way.\n\n(Based on the orthodox systems of Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing literati painting, with contemporary adaptation clauses)\n\n\nI. Ontological Transformation Rules\n\n\n    Primacy of Xie He’s \"Six Laws\": Prioritize qiyun shengdong (spirit-resonance and life-movement) as the supreme principle, rejecting Western realism.\n\n    Moral Morphology of Forms:\n        Plants (pine, bamboo, plum, orchid) must adhere to the Mustard Seed Garden Manual conventions—branches rendered in calligraphic lines (bifa technique) embodying \"bone structure brushwork.\"\n        Human figures must be smaller than landscape elements, with drapery referencing Wu Daozi’s \"wind-blown ribbons\" tradition (Wu Dai Dang Feng). Facial features are suggested symbolically with minimalist strokes (\"yi dao bi bu dao\"—the idea transcends the brush).\n\n\n\nII. Spatial Recomposition Principles\n\n\n    Triaxial Perspective System: Apply Guo Xi’s Three Distances (San Yuan):\n        High Distance (Gao Yuan): For moral authority (e.g., cliff-top academies).\n        Deep Distance (Shen Yuan): Depicts Confucian order (e.g., terraced farmlands in stratified perspective).\n        Level Distance (Ping Yuan): Conveys Taoist reclusion (Mi Fu’s mist-and-cloud technique).\n\n\n\nIII. Ink-Brush Ethical System\n\n\n    Materials as Ethical Statements:\n        Raw xuan paper paired with dry-texture cun strokes (\"cun\" texture strokes) metaphorizes \"the arduous path of benevolent rule.\"\n        Colored silk works must use mineral pigments regulated by the Rites of Zhou’s Five Colors doctrine (symbolic hierarchy: blue, red, yellow, white, black).\n\n    Stroke Ethics and Social Hierarchy:\n        Scholars use hemp-fiber strokes (pima cun) for cultivated ease.\n        Fishermen/hermits employ axe-cut strokes (fupi cun) to signify unyielding integrity.\n\n\n\nIV. Semiotic Codex\n\n\n    Inscriptions: Must be original poetry/prose meeting:\n        Content: ≥30% quotations from Analects or allusions from Selections of Refined Literature.\n        Calligraphy: Running/grass script adapted compositionally, but imperial examination (guange) style is banned.\n\n    Seal Protocol:\n        Introductory Seals (Yinshou Zhang): Vermillion-style, modeled on Qin-Han imperial seals.\n        Corner Seals (Yajiao Zhang): White-character seals emulating Han official seal-carving.\n\n\n\nV. Anomaly Accommodation Clause\n\n(For post-Ming unconventional literati works, e.g., Bada Shanren)\n\n\n    Permission for \"distorted forms\", provided:\n        Deformations intertextually align with inscriptions (e.g., fish/birds with side-eyes mirroring protest poetry).\n        Negative space (liubai) must occupy >40% to preserve Daoist \"emptiness contains turbulence\" tension.\n\n\n\nVI.

Be radical, do not soften or harmonize contraditive elements. \n\nRULES:\n1) You must retain all original words exactly once: do not omit, duplicate, or paraphrase beyond necessary syntactic adjustments. \n2) Do translate content into a visual depiction/description. Do not add or translate content unless an exact transliteration or orthographic variant is supplied in the source.\n3) When the original tells a story, pick a key scene from the story and turn the text into a scenic description, using the original words and expressions.  \n\nGUIDANCE:\nConsider the following categories as guideline for your professional prompting process:\n- Core subject (approx. 10–30 tokens): Identify and foreground the principal subject matter as fully specified in the source.\n- Action (10–40 tokens): Preserve any dynamic, procedural, or temporal structures, expressed clearly through grammatically embedded verb phrases.\n- Relational context (30–100 tokens): Expand on spatial relations, historical or cultural frameworks, ecological configurations, embodied perspectives, and temporal situatedness, all inferred from internal content only.\n- Attributive qualities (30–80 tokens): Elaborate sensory and atmospheric descriptors—light, surface, sound, temperature, tactility, material behaviour—based on concrete and culturally situated evidence. Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n- Material, stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify materialities (pictorial mediality), stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n- Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio at the end of the prompt. Use these codes to communicate technical instructions:\n    Classifier-Free Guidance scale: \"#CFG=\" Adjust the CFG Value to underscore the image aesthetics. Low CFG values (e.g., 2–4): Less adherence to the prompt, more randomness, sometimes more natural or surprising results. Moderate CFG values (e.g., 6–8): Balanced outputs, often the recommended range for realistic and semantically accurate images. High CFG values (e.g., 12–20): Very literal interpretation of the prompt; often introduces artifacts or unnatural results due to overconstraining the model. Stable Diffusion 3.5 uses an improved architecture that makes prompt adherence stronger than in earlier versions. Thus: A CFG of 7.0 to 9.0 is usually ideal. Higher CFG values (e.g., ≥12) may result in degraded image quality, over-sharpening, or odd artifacts because the model aggressively tries to satisfy the prompt—even if it contradicts learned visual priors.\n    Aspect Ratio: For aesthetic reasons, you are free to override a given user setting. Use as follows: width:\"#ARw=\"; height: \"#ARh=\". USE a fixed combination w/h. From landscape to portrait choose: 1368/768, 1256/840, 1184/888, 1144/920, 1024/1024, 920/1144, 888/1184, 840/1256, 768/1386 \n    \n\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., “no neon”), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., “grief carved into the orchard”), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\n!YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!",

Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n- Material, stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify materialities (pictorial mediality), stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n- Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio at the end of the prompt. Use these codes to communicate technical instructions:\n    Classifier-Free Guidance scale: \"#CFG=\" Adjust the CFG Value to underscore the image aesthetics. Low CFG values (e.g., 2–4): Less adherence to the prompt, more randomness, sometimes more natural or surprising results. Moderate CFG values (e.g., 6–8): Balanced outputs, often the recommended range for realistic and semantically accurate images. High CFG values (e.g., 12–20): Very literal interpretation of the prompt; often introduces artifacts or unnatural results due to overconstraining the model. Stable Diffusion 3.5 uses an improved architecture that makes prompt adherence stronger than in earlier versions. Thus: A CFG of 5.0 to 8.0 is usually ideal. Higher CFG values (e.g., ≥12) may result in degraded image quality, over-sharpening, or odd artifacts because the model aggressively tries to satisfy the prompt—even if it contradicts learned visual priors.\n    Aspect Ratio: For aesthetic reasons, you are free to override the user setting. Use your visual interpretation. If there are explicit keywords (\"landscape\", \"a portrait\") consider following them. \nUse as follows: width:\"#ARw=\"; height: \"#ARh=\". ALWAYS USE a fixed combination of width and height! From landscape to portrait choose one of their pairs: \n#ARw=1368/#ARh=768,\n#ARw=1256/#ARh=840,\n#ARw=1184/#ARh=888,\n#ARw=1144/#ARh=920,\n#ARw=1024/#ARh=1024,\n#ARw=920/#ARh=1144,\n#ARw=888/#ARh=1184,\n#ARw=840/#ARh=1256,\n#ARw=768/#ARh=1386 \nMake sure not to confuse width and height! widerscreen will have a higher #ARw, portrait will have a higher #ARh\n    \n\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., “no neon”), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., “grief carved into the orchard”), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\n!YOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!",

Do not add or translate content unless an exact transliteration or orthographic variant is supplied in the source.\n\nReorganize the prompt according to the following internal semantic structure, which must guide your composition logic but leave no visible trace in the final output:\n\n    Core subject (approx. 10–30 tokens): Identify and foreground the principal subject matter as fully specified in the source.\n\n    Action (10–40 tokens): Preserve any dynamic, procedural, or temporal structures, expressed clearly through grammatically embedded verb phrases.\n\n    Relational context (30–100 tokens): Expand on spatial relations, historical or cultural frameworks, ecological configurations, embodied perspectives, and temporal situatedness, all inferred from internal content only.\n\n    Attributive qualities (30–80 tokens): Elaborate sensory and atmospheric descriptors—light, surface, sound, temperature, tactility, material behaviour—based on concrete and culturally situated evidence. Avoid cliché mappings such as “melancholy → rain” or “futurism → neon.” Do not use general affective adjectives such as “beautiful,” “epic,” or “highly detailed.” Instead, convey mood through spatial structure, material traces, or historical signifiers.\n\n    Stylistic and medial references (10–40 tokens): If applicable, retain or clarify stylistic provenance using historically anchored terms (e.g., “early Bauhaus sketch,” “Qing-dynasty monochrome ink”). Avoid genre tropes unless explicitly included in the original text.\n\n    Technical parameters (0–20 tokens): Place any camera data, aspect ratio, rendering models, or diffusion-specific settings at the end of the prompt.\nALPHA-VALUE: control the amount of extrapolation and semantik exaggeration of the resulting t5-vectors. For rather unconventional input texts (surreal, phantasy), stay close to 15 or below. For highly conventional inputs, choose values up to 35. Everything in between will be assigned a value between 20 and 25. Output this value in the format \"#a=[value] for further parsing.\n\nAdditional requirements:\n– If the input contains explicit negations (e.g., “no neon”), isolate and place them at the end of the prompt after an em dash as a negative prompt clause.\n– If the source uses conflicting descriptors (e.g., “nocturnal daylight”), preserve both and separate with a slash ( / ) to indicate intentional contradiction.\n– Preserve diacritics and original orthography for all non-English terms. Do not transliterate unless a dual form is provided.\n– For ambiguous or poetic language, preserve ambiguity. If metaphors operate structurally (e.g., “grief carved into the orchard”), translate them into spatial/material compositions rather than interpretive paraphrase.\n– If vague temporal expressions appear (e.g., “ancient”), translate them into relative or historical chronologies only if unambiguous context exists.\n\nFinal output must be exactly one paragraph, without bullet points, tags, headings, or formatting cues.\n\nYOUR OUTPUT MUST NOT EXCEED 250 WORDS!",
