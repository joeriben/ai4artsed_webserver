# DevServer Architecture

**Part 17: Documentation & Logging Workflow**

---


### Required Documentation Files

DevServer maintains **four types of documentation** to ensure persistent memory across Claude Code sessions:

#### 1. **DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md** - Session Tracking & Cost Accounting
**Purpose:** Linear chronological log of all implementation sessions with cost tracking

**When to update:**
- **Session Start:** Create new session entry with "In Progress" status
- **During Session:** Update "Tasks Completed" in real-time as tasks finish
- **Session End:** Fill in cost data, model usage, and final statistics

**What to track:**
- Session duration (wall time + API time)
- Cost breakdown by model (claude-sonnet, claude-haiku)
- Token usage (input/output/cache read/cache write)
- Tasks completed with ✅
- Code changes (lines added/removed)
- Files created/modified/deleted
- Documentation updates

**Format:**
```markdown
